Localbitcoins has a dispute resolution system in place to handle these sorts of issues - but on the flipside there is a reputation based system - so you can gauge whether your trading party is reliable or not.\nTrading fees vary and depend on whether you have placed an advert to sell - whereby LocalBitcoins takes a 1% fee. \nIn all a good means to exchange Bitcoin but it doesn't have the razor edge price discovery, and execution time of more traditional order driven exchanges.\nMedium | Facebook | Instagram | LinkedIn | YouTube | Reddit","FullAddress":"Unknown","Fees":"Bitcoin trading:\nRegistering, buying, and selling Bitcoin is completely free.\nLocalBitcoins users who create advertisements are charged a 1% fee for every completed trade.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees:\nTransactions to wallets of other LocalBitcoins users are free.\nIncoming transactions to LocalBitcoins wallets are free, but a minimum deposit limit is applicable.

trading, quantitative trading tools, an NFT marketplace, and the Gate Card for cryptocurrency-based payments.\nImpact and Contributions to the Industry\n- Market Standing: As of April 2025, Gate

SafeCoin, initiated in late 2017 by Jeff Galloway and a team of blockchain developers, aimed to create a secure and scalable blockchain solution. SafeTrade was established to support this vision by providing a reliable and secure trading platform for SafeCoin and other digital assets.\nInitially, SafeTrade was closely tied to SafeCoin's development activities, reflecting a shared focus on security and community engagement. During its beta phase, the exchange offered a limited selection of trading pairs, primarily focusing on SafeCoin and related assets. Feedback from the SafeCoin community played a crucial role in shaping the platform’s features and security protocols.\n2018: Launch and Community Integration SafeTrade's launch was marked by its strong emphasis on supporting the SafeCoin ecosystem. The platform catered to SafeCoin holders and provided a secure venue for trading SafeCoin and other emerging cryptocurrencies. Early operations were guided by a commitment to user safety and a community-centric approach, which helped establish SafeTrade as a trusted platform within its niche.\n2019: Expansion and Security Enhancements In 2019, SafeTrade expanded its cryptocurrency offerings beyond SafeCoin and its immediate ecosystem. This period saw the introduction of new trading pairs and platform features designed to appeal to a broader user base. Significant upgrades were made to the exchange’s security infrastructure, including the implementation of mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) and increased use of cold storage to safeguard user funds.\n2020: Strategic Relocation and Regulatory Compliance By 2020, SafeTrade had registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This strategic relocation aimed to take advantage of the jurisdiction’s favourable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency operations. The move provided SafeTrade with a robust legal framework and enhanced its ability to offer secure and compliant trading services. This shift marked a pivotal moment in the exchange's development, positioning it for greater operational stability and regulatory adherence.\n2020–2021: International Expansion and Technological Upgrades During this period, SafeTrade aligned its growth with significant advancements in the SafeCoin ecosystem. In 2021, SafeCoin transitioned to the Solana codebase, leveraging Solana’s high throughput and scalability. SafeTrade played a key role in facilitating this transition, supporting the token swap and continuing to provide a secure trading environment for the upgraded ecosystem. This upgrade was crucial for maintaining the platform’s performance and security as it scaled to accommodate more users and higher transaction volumes.\nIntroduction of SafeBridge In 2021, SafeTrade introduced SafeBridge, a solution designed to enhance interoperability between different blockchain networks. SafeBridge allows for more flexible and secure cross-chain interactions, broadening the scope of trading options available on SafeTrade. This innovation reflects SafeTrade’s commitment to supporting technological advancements and providing users with versatile trading capabilities.\nOngoing Commitment to Community and Security Today, SafeTrade remains deeply integrated with the SafeCoin ecosystem and continues to prioritize community engagement and user security. The exchange actively interacts with its user base through platforms like Discord, gathering feedback to drive continuous improvement. SafeTrade’s dedication to security is evident in its ongoing implementation of advanced security measures and its focus on maintaining a user-friendly platform.\nSafeTrade offers a variety of services designed to meet the needs of both novice and experienced cryptocurrency traders:\n\n\nSpot Trading: Supports a broad range of cryptocurrencies, including major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a special focus on assets related to the SafeCoin ecosystem.\n\n\nUser-Friendly Interface: The platform features a clean and intuitive design, making it accessible and easy to navigate for users of all experience levels.\n\n\nAdvanced Security Measures: SafeTrade employs robust security protocols, such as mandatory 2FA and extensive cold storage, to protect user funds.\n\n\nCommunity and Token Support: The exchange supports the initial listing of new tokens, especially those developed within its community, providing essential liquidity and market access for emerging digital assets.\n\n\nSafeTrade has made significant contributions to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly within the SafeCoin community and among smaller, innovative digital asset projects.

It also provides a hardened price oracle that accumulates the relative price of the two assets at the beginning of each block.

Each Uniswap v1 pair stores pooled reserves of two assets, and provides liquidity for those two assets, maintaining the invariant that the product of the reserves cannot decrease. Traders pay a 30-basis-point fee on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. The contracts are non-upgradeable.\nUniswap v2 is a new implementation based on the same formula, with several new highly-desirable features. Most significantly, it enables the creation of arbitrary ERC20/ERC20 pairs, rather than supporting only pairs between ERC20 and ETH. It also provides a hardened price oracle that accumulates the relative price of the two assets at the beginning of each block. This allows other contracts on Ethereum to estimate the time-weighted average price for the two assets over arbitrary intervals. Finally, it enables “flash swaps” where users can receive assets freely and use them elsewhere on the chain, only paying for (or returning) those assets at the end of the transaction.\nIn Uniswap v3, when compared to Uniswap and Uniswap v2, Liquidity Providers have more control over where they are able to place their capital. Liquidity Providers in Uniswapv 3 are able to use their capital in more flexible and narrower price ranges that were not previously possible in Uniswapv2. This means that Liquidity Providers can collect more fees for less capital. Also, traders who want to trade or exchange their tokens will enjoy prices that are closer to where they want to complete their exchange.","FullAddress":"Unknown","Fees":"Uniswap v3 offers three different fee tiers: 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1.00%. These options are introduced so that liquidity providers make their strategies based on the risks they are willing to take. The lowest fee tier of 0.05% may be ideal for stablecoins. In Uniswap v3, there can be multiple pools for the same token pair.","DepositMethods":"Cryptocurrency","WithdrawalMethods":"Cryptocurrency","Sponsored":false,"Recommended":false,"Rating":{"One":0,"Two":0,"Three":0,"Four":0,"Five":0,"Avg":0,"TotalUsers":0},"SortOrder":"322","TOTALVOLUME24H":{"BTC":0},"DISPLAYTOTALVOLUME24H":{"BTC":"Ƀ 0"}},"943129":{"Id":"943129","Name":"PancakeSwap (v2)","Url":"/exchanges/pancakeswap-v2/overview","LogoUrl":"/media/38553321/pancakeswapv2.png","ItemType":["Cryptocurrency","Stable Coins","Tokens"],"CentralizationType":"Decentralized","InternalName":"pancakeswap","GradePoints":0,"Grade":"-","GradePointsSplit":{"Legal":"0","KYCAndTransactionRisk":"0","Team":"0","DataProvision":"0","AssetQualityAndDiversity":"0","MarketQuality":"0","Security":"0","NegativeReportsPenalty":"0"},"AffiliateURL":"https://pancakeswap.finance/","Country":"Unknown","OrderBook":false,"Trades":true,"Description":"PancakeSwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM), and the Exchange is at the heart of PancakeSwap.
