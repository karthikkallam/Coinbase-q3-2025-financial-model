This repository contains my financial model and analysis for the Coinbase Financial Challenge. The model forecasts Q3 2025 revenue of $1,734M across transaction revenue ($976M), subscriptions & services ($679M), and other revenue ($79M), incorporating detailed assumptions for trading volumes, take rates, USDC interest income, staking revenue, and custody fees. All projections are based on Q2'25 10-Q data, Circle USDC attestations, FRED interest rate data, public exchange volume metrics, and sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios.
