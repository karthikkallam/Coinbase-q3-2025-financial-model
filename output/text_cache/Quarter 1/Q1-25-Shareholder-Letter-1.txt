First Quarter 2025

May 8, 2025

We delivered strong financial results in Q1, generating $2.0 billion in total revenue, $66 million in net income, 
$527 million in Adjusted Net Income (excluding the tax-effected impact of crypto investment asset gains/
losses), and $930 million in Adjusted EBITDA. Total transaction revenue was $1.3 billion and subscription and 
services revenue was nearly $700 million, driven by growth in stablecoin revenue and Coinbase One. With $9.9 
billion in total $USD resources, we are well-positioned to drive further innovation and long-term growth.

This quarter, we made meaningful progress against our 2025 priorities of driving revenue, driving utility, and 
building the foundations to power the next decade of growth. We continued to gain market share in both global 
spot and derivatives. USDC—the #2 dollar-backed stablecoin in the world—saw continued momentum, with its 
market cap reaching new all-time highs of over $60 billion, and further supported by growing balances among 
both our retail and institutional users. We also deepened our global presence, earning critical registrations in 
Argentina and India.

We advanced crypto utility with new offerings like Bitcoin-backed USDC loans, and acquisitions like Spindl and 
Iron Fish to enhance Base’s capabilities in privacy and usability. Coinbase One continued to grow as customers 
continue to find value in zero trading fees, account takeover protection, and boosted USDC rewards rates 
which we augmented this quarter with new features like boosted staking rewards and free gas on Base.

We also achieved major milestones in policy and legal advocacy. The Executive Order’s direction to establish a 
Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marked a historic recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset, and advancements in 
bipartisan crypto legislation demonstrated progress toward clearer frameworks. The dismissal of the SEC 
lawsuit against Coinbase marked a major judicial win for balanced, innovation-friendly regulation, and our 
efforts to make crypto mainstream. 

Looking ahead, we’re focused on expanding real-world crypto utility, strengthening and extending our trading 
platform, and scaling the infrastructure that will power the financial system of the future. With growing 
regulatory clarity, we're accelerating our vision towards economic freedom.

Additionally, we are pleased to announce we have reached an agreement to acquire Sentillia B.V. (Deribit), the 
world’s leading crypto options exchange with over $30.0 billion in open interest and over $1 trillion in trading 
volume last year. We believe this strategic acquisition will establish Coinbase as the premier global platform for 
crypto derivatives, enhance profitability, and add diversity and durability to our trading revenues. We are 
acquiring Deribit for approximately $2.9 billion*, comprised of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of 
Coinbase common stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. This transaction is subject to 
regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by year-end.

Fellow 
Shareholders,

Chapter 1: Strong Q1 results and market share gains in a volatile market. Q1 total revenue was $2.0 
billion, down 10% Q/Q. Transaction revenue was $1.3 billion, down 19% Q/Q. Subscription and services 
revenue grew 9% Q/Q to $698 million, driven primarily by stablecoin revenue as USDC market cap reached an 
all-time high of over $60 billion, and average USDC held in Coinbase products1 grew to $12.3 billion. Total 
operating expenses were $1.3 billion, up 7% Q/Q, of which technology & development, general & 
administrative, and sales & marketing expenses were collectively $997 million, up 4% Q/Q. Net income was 
$66 million, Adjusted Net Income was $527 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was $930 million. Our balance sheet 
strengthened, as we ended Q1 with $9.9 billion in $USD resources.

Chapter 2: Building the financial system of the future. In Q1, Coinbase advanced its mission by expanding 
access to trading through global derivatives growth and advanced tools, deepening financial utility via USDC 
adoption and Bitcoin-backed loans, and upgrading infrastructure with innovations like Verified Pools and Base 
improvements. These efforts not only empower institutions and everyday users but also position Coinbase as a 
leader in driving faster, fairer, and more open financial systems.

Chapter 3: Policy, litigation, and regulation. In Q1, Coinbase drove significant progress in shaping the U.S. 
policy landscape for crypto, advocating for bipartisan regulation, achieving pivotal court victories, and engaging 
with top government officials. Landmark developments, such as directing the establishment of the Strategic 
Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, validated digital assets as sovereign financial infrastructure. We 
secured the dismissal with prejudice of our SEC lawsuit. With crypto now a central topic in Washington, we are 
a key voice advocating for innovation-friendly regulation and positioned to help shape a clear and responsible 
regulatory framework for the future.

Chapter 4: Q2’25 Outlook. In April, we generated approximately $240 million of total transaction revenue. We 
expect Q2 subscription and services revenue to be within $600-$680 million, as we anticipate Q/Q growth in 
stablecoin revenue to be more than offset by a decline in blockchain rewards revenue due to lower asset 
prices. We expect Q2 transaction expenses to be in the mid-teens as a percent of net revenue. We expect 
technology & development and general & administrative expenses to range from $700-$750 million. Finally, we 
expect sales & marketing expenses to be in the range of $215-$315 million, driven by potential variability in 1) 
performance marketing and 2) customer USDC balances in Coinbase products, which drive USDC rewards.

Chapter 1

We had strong Q1 results, gained market share, and generated $2.0 billion in 
revenue, $66 million in net income, and $930 million of Adjusted EBITDA.

Q1 total revenue was $2.0 billion, down 10% Q/Q. Transaction revenue was $1.3 billion, down 19% Q/Q. 

Subscription and services revenue grew 9% Q/Q to $698 million, driven primarily by stablecoin revenue—as 

USDC market cap reached an all-time high of over $60 billion and average USDC held in Coinbase products 

grew to $12.3 billion—and continued growth of Coinbase One. Total operating expenses were $1.3 billion, up 

7% Q/Q, of which technology & development, general & administrative, and sales & marketing expenses were 

collectively $997 million, up 4% Q/Q. These expenses grew largely due to increased variable expenses 

including marketing spend (primarily performance marketing and USDC rewards), as well as higher customer 

support costs. Net income was $66 million, Adjusted Net Income was $527 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was 

$930 million. 

Note: Figures presented may not 
sum precisely due to rounding.

revenue has been condensed into 
Other Subscription and Services 
revenue and will no longer be 
disclosed as a separate line item 
as it now comprises a smaller 
percentage of our subscription and 
services revenue. Prior periods

Transaction Revenue

2 Crypto Asset Volatility represents 
our internal measure of crypto 
asset volatility in the market 
relative to prior periods. The 
volatility is based on intraday 
returns of a volume-weighted 
basket of all assets listed on our 
trading platform. These returns are 
used to compute the basket’s 
intraday volatility which is then 
scaled to a daily window. These 
daily volatility values are then 
averaged over the applicable time 
period as needed.

Q1 saw increased average Crypto Asset Volatility2 with BTC reaching a new all-time high price in January. 
However, crypto prices dropped alongside broader market declines driven by tariff policy and macroeconomic 

uncertainty. Total crypto market cap declined 19% to $2.7 trillion when comparing the end of Q1 to the end of 

Q4.

Against this backdrop, Q1 transaction revenue was $1.3 billion, down 19% Q/Q. Coinbase total spot volume 

declined 10% Q/Q to $393.1 billion outperforming the broader global spot market where trading volume 

declined 13% Q/Q. 

On the derivatives side, we are continuing to build our business both in the U.S. and internationally by new 
contract listings, capital efficiency features, and targeted incentives. In Q1, we drove $803.6 billion in global 
derivatives trading volume and continued to grow market share.

1 Trading Volume represents the 
total US dollar equivalent value of 
spot matched trades transacted 
between a buyer and seller 
through our platform during the 
period of measurement.

Consumer Transaction Revenue. Q1 Consumer Trading Volume1 was $78.1 billion, down 17% Q/Q. 
Consumer transaction revenue was $1.1 billion, down 19% Q/Q, largely in-line with the decline in Trading 

Volume.

Institutional Transaction Revenue. Institutional Trading Volume was $315.0 billion, down 9% Q/Q, and 

institutional transaction revenue was $99 million, down 30% Q/Q. 

Our Institutional Trading Volume outperformed the global spot market. Spot volume mix shifted in Q1 and was 

more concentrated among market makers and liquidity providers which tend to have lower fee rates. The 

second driver of the Q/Q revenue decline was due to our derivatives business.

As we build this business, we are investing in trading rebates and incentives to build liquidity and attract 

customers. These rebates and incentives, which are netted against our institutional transaction revenue, offset 

a larger portion of the net revenue contribution of derivatives trading in Q1 as compared to Q4. As a reminder, 

our reported Trading Volume is spot only.

Other Transaction Revenue. Other transaction revenue was $68 million in Q1, flat Q/Q. Our efforts to drive 

more scale and lower costs are paying off as the number of transactions on Base increased 16% Q/Q, while 

average revenue per transaction decreased 21%. We believe that the sustained growth in transactions is a 

result of lower fees and growing utility.

Subscription and Services Revenue

Q1 subscription and services revenue was $698 million, up 9% Q/Q, primarily driven by growth in stablecoin 

and Coinbase One revenue, partially offset by lower blockchain rewards revenue. 

Stablecoin revenue increased 32% Q/Q to $298 million in Q1. Average USDC held in Coinbase products 

increased 49% Q/Q to $12.3 billion driven by longstanding efforts to better integrate USDC across our product 

experience and our rewards program. Growth was partially offset by lower average interest rates which 

declined 7% Q/Q. Product integration highlights from Q1 include:

Since implementing the current version of our rewards program in June 2023, the number of MTUs1 
holding USDC has doubled and average USDC balances per holder has increased 3x

Reaching new all-time high in customer balances on our International exchange, where all order 

books are denominated in USDC, which we supercharged with deposit incentives

Significant increase in institutional USDC balances, as customers are increasingly embracing onchain 

utility via our Prime Onchain Wallet

Average off-platform USDC balances increased 39% Q/Q to $41.9 billion, which was driven by growth in USDC 

usage across onchain dapps, and expanded distribution partnerships.

We continue to be pleased with our long-term partnership with Circle, and the growth of the USDC ecosystem. 

By integrating USDC more deeply into our products and driving adoption, we’ve increased our monetization of 

ecosystem economics over time. We’re optimistic about expanding USDC’s reach further through continued 

innovation and product integration.

Blockchain rewards revenue in Q1 was $197 million down 9% Q/Q. The decline was largely driven by lower 
average asset prices Q/Q, notably ETH and SOL, and was partially offset by higher rewards rates on the 

Solana blockchain. Staked balances declined modestly Q/Q as users unstaked assets to trade in the early Q1 

volatility. However, staked balances returned to growth in the second half of the quarter.

Q1 interest and finance fee income was $63 million, down 4% Q/Q. Interest income on customer fiat balances 

was up Q/Q driven by higher balances and was partially offset by lower interest rates. Prime Financing revenue 

was down as average loan balances declined in connection with customers deleveraging in light of higher 

volatility market conditions. Customer interest in this product remains strong as we saw a double digit 

percentage increase Q/Q in the number of clients who onboarded to our Prime Financing platform. We 

upgraded our portfolio margin experience in Q1 to enable direct trading into margin positions, simplifying the 

experience and enhancing scalability, we anticipate which will allow us to layer in new custodial and margining 

capabilities later this year.

Starting in Q1’25, Custodial Fee revenue has been condensed into Other subscription and services revenue 

and will no longer be disclosed as a separate line item as it now comprises a smaller percentage of our 

subscription and services revenue. 

Other subscription and services revenue was $141 million, up 5% Q/Q. We reached a new all-time high for 

Coinbase One subscribers as momentum continued in Q1, and also saw strong uptake of our Coinbase One 

Premium offering ($300/month). Moving forward, we remain committed to refining and experimenting with 

Coinbase One's value proposition, including exploring new tiered offerings that cater to diverse customer 

needs. Custodial Fee revenue growth was driven by strong net inflows across a diverse array of customers and 

an increase in average asset prices Q/Q (principally BTC).

5

       
Expenses

Q1 total operating expenses were $1.3 billion—up 7% or $91 million Q/Q—primarily driven by increased 

variable expenses given elevated market activity early in the quarter and losses on crypto assets held for 

operations (price movement between receiving and selling staking rewards earned as commission for 

example). Technology & development, general & administrative, and sales & marketing expenses collectively 

increased by $40 million or 4% Q/Q, driven largely by increased marketing spend (including performance 

marketing and USDC rewards) and higher customer support costs. We ended the quarter with 3,959 full-time 

employees, up 5% Q/Q.

Note: Figures presented may not 
sum precisely due to rounding.

2024, we reclassified certain policy 
expenses from Other operating 
expenses, net to General and

Q1 transaction expenses were $303 million or 15% of net revenue, down 4% Q/Q. The Q/Q decrease was 

largely due to lower customer trading activity and lower blockchain reward fees related to lower average asset 

prices. 

Technology and development expenses were $355 million, down 4% Q/Q. The decrease was primarily driven 

by lower personnel related expenses despite higher total headcount. This was largely due to the update in 

timing of stock-based compensation expense recognition we noted in the Q3’24 shareholder letter, in addition 

to higher capitalization of internally developed technology. This decline was partially offset by an increase in 

variable software and web hosting related spend.

General and administrative expenses were $394 million, up 9% Q/Q. Growth was driven primarily by higher 

customer support and personnel related costs.

Sales and marketing expenses were $247 million, up 10% Q/Q. Growth was largely driven by higher 
performance marketing spend to capitalize on strong market conditions early in Q1, and higher USDC rewards 

as we reached new all-time highs in balances in Coinbase products. As indicated in our Q4 shareholder letter, 

the trajectory of our performance marketing spend is opportunistic depending on market conditions.

Stock-based compensation expense was $191 million, down 14% Q/Q. 

Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 20%, approximately in-line with the U.S. statutory rate.

Net income in Q1 was $66 million and was impacted by $597 million in pre-tax losses on our crypto asset 

investment portfolio, the vast majority of which were unrealized. Adjusted net income was $527 million and 

Adjusted EBITDA was $930 million.

Share Count

Our fully diluted share count at the end of Q1 was 290 million. Included in this figure are 255 million common 

shares and 35 million in dilutive shares. In Q1, we also withheld approximately 388 thousand shares from net 

6

share settlement of employee equity grants. Instead of selling shares into the market to cover employee taxes 

on equity awards, the company pays the taxes and we withhold those shares, which has the same effect as a 

stock buyback.

Capital and Liquidity

At the end of Q1, we had $9.9 billion in $USD resources, which we define as cash and cash equivalents and 

USDC (net of USDC loaned or pledged as collateral). Our $USD resources increased $626 million Q/Q or 7%.

We consider our crypto assets for investment and certain crypto assets held as collateral as other liquidity 

resources available to us. In Q1, we purchased $153 million of crypto assets for our investment portfolio, 

primarily concentrated in BTC. We are investing in crypto assets to meet regulatory capital needs, support 

growing utility, and reinforce our long-term commitment to the crypto economy. As of March 31, 2025, the fair 

market value of our crypto assets held for investment and our crypto assets held as collateral were $1.3 billion 

and $598 million, respectively. When including these crypto assets, total available resources totaled $11.8 

billion.

Collateralized Arrangements & Financing and Counterparty Risk

We maintained our longstanding commitment to operational and risk excellence in Q1. At the end of Q1, we 

had $749 million in total credit and counterparty risk (excluding banks), stemming from $517 million in 

collateralized loans to customers and $232 million held at third-party venues (including $136 million in 

unrestricted cash). As a reminder, our loans require 100%+ in collateral and are subject to rigorous risk 

monitoring.

Chapter 2

Product — Building the Financial System of the Future

Crypto is Freedom: Freedom starts with financial sovereignty—and that means control over your money. At 

Coinbase, we see crypto evolving in three phases: first, as a new asset class, second, as a better financial 

system, and third, as the app platform layer for a new internet. In Q1, we made progress across all three—

advancing trading, scaling stablecoins, expanding access to financial services, and building the infrastructure 

to support the next generation of onchain apps. Each product we shipped brings us closer to a world where 

anyone, anywhere can access faster, fairer, and more open financial services.

Crypto as a New Asset Class: Trading is often the first step into crypto—it’s how people learn the value of 

digital assets, understand how blockchains work, and begin building trust in the ecosystem. In Q1, we 

expanded access to this entry point by launching more advanced trading tools, scaling derivatives globally, and 

growing institutional and retail utility.

Institutional Partner of Choice Across Custody, Trading, and Financing

•

•

Average assets under custody grew $25 billion Q/Q to $212 billion, driven by average native unit 
inflows from ETF issuers, corporates, and high net worth individuals.

Launched Portfolio Margin 2.0, which lets institutional clients trade on margin without pre-funding, 

using their existing portfolio as collateral. This enables faster execution, greater capital efficiency, and 

real-time risk management.

Coinbase One: Unlocking Onchain Utility for the Everyday User

•

Continued to increase the value proposition of Coinbase One through new benefits and benefit 

expansion into new markets. In Q1, we added 10 new onchain benefits (free gas on Base, boosted 

staking rewards, access to top dapps, and much more). Additionally, subscribers benefited from 

exclusive partnerships to enable them to file crypto taxes.

•

Overall, Coinbase One is less volatile than our overall trading business - we’re seeing healthy levels of 

retention, on average, and expansion of members choosing annual over monthly plans. 

Scaling Our Derivatives Footprint Across U.S. and Global Markets

•

•

•

In Q1, we drove over $800 billion in global derivatives trading volume, and while still early, saw 

significant market share increase driven by Coinbase International Exchange, where our perpetual 

futures market share increased over 60%.

Coinbase International Exchange launched 39 new perpetual contracts, expanded collateral types 

from 3 to 8 assets, raised position limits, and boosted USDC rewards to 12% for USDC on the 

exchange - all of which resulted in a 2.9x increase in client assets on the exchange in Q1. 

In Q1, Coinbase Derivatives announced the upcoming launch of the first 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum 

futures on a CFTC-regulated U.S. exchange—bringing round-the-clock risk management to U.S. 

traders and bridging a key gap with traditional markets.

Verified Pools: Trusted Liquidity, Onchain

•

Launched Coinbase Verified Pools, an innovative product that makes onchain trading safer and easier 

by allowing users to connect their wallets to pools where all participants are identity-verified, helping 

reduce counterparty risk and improve trust.

• Whether you're a retail trader or an institution, Verified Pools offer a simple, non-custodial way to 

provide or access liquidity directly onchain, all built on Coinbase’s secure infrastructure.

Crypto as a New Financial System: The financial system wasn’t built for the internet era—it’s slow, 

expensive, and exclusionary. Crypto changes that by enabling faster, cheaper, and more open financial 

infrastructure. In Q1, we made major progress on this front: expanding crypto adoption globally, scaling 

stablecoin adoption, and upgrading the speed and privacy of Base.

Accelerating Global Expansion Through Regulatory Progress

•

•

•

Secured Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration in Argentina, unlocking the ability to offer 

fully localized services—local rails, localized experience, local marketing—in a high-adoption, high-

need market.

Became the largest FCA-registered VASP in the UK, enabling us to scale retail, institutional, and 

developer services in our biggest international market.

Registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit, paving the way for launching trading in one of the 

fastest-growing onchain developer ecosystems.

USDC - The World’s 2nd Largest Stablecoin - Surges to All-Time High as Onchain Utility Accelerates

•

•

•

USDC market cap reached a record of over $60 billion in Q1, up 38% year-to-date, driven by 

institutional demand, onchain adoption, and record trading activity on Coinbase International 
Exchange, where it serves as the primary collateral and settlement asset.

Coinbase Prime reached an all-time high in institutional USDC balances driven in part by continued 

demand for Prime Onchain Wallet.

From retail loans to global remittances, USDC is becoming a foundational building block of the 

onchain economy—with Coinbase as its key distribution engine.

Enabling Bitcoin-backed Loans Through Onchain Innovation

•

Launched the ability to borrow USDC against bitcoin directly in the Coinbase app. Powered by 

Morpho, an open-source lending protocol built on Base, offering flexible, low-friction access to liquidity. 

We have seen over $160 million in loans since launch.

Crypto as an App Platform: Crypto isn’t just upgrading finance—it’s becoming the platform layer for a new 

internet. At the center of that evolution is Base, our Ethereum L2 designed to power the next generation of 

onchain apps. In Q1, we made key infrastructure upgrades to make Base faster, safer, and easier to build on—

laying the foundation for global-scale app adoption.

•

•

•

Ecosystem growth accelerating: Base stablecoin balances reached $4 billion in Q1, up 12% Q/Q, 

as developers and users increasingly build and transact on Base.

Launched Flashblocks (testnet): Cut block times from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds—paving the 

way for sub-second, sub-cent onchain transactions.

Acquired Iron Fish team: Their experience building safe, accessible, and compliance-friendly privacy 

tools enables us to accelerate our work in areas like private payments and transparent, privacy-

preserving DeFi. Together, we’re giving builders the tools they need to create secure, scalable, and 

privacy-first applications onchain.

•

Acquired Spindl: Builders often say it’s hard to find users. To help solve that issue, Spindl built a 

robust onchain advertising protocol that helps builders find their audience. Now that they’ve joined 

Base, we’re helping builders grow faster and reach more people across Coinbase and beyond.

Chapter 3

Policy, Litigation, and Regulation

Q1 marked a turning point in the U.S. policy landscape—shifting from gridlock to tangible momentum. Across 

legislation, regulation, and litigation, the direction of travel is clear: progress. After years of uncertainty, digital 

asset policy is advancing through bipartisan proposals, court victories, and increased executive engagement. 

Coinbase is at the forefront—advocating for smart regulation, defending innovation, and securing legal wins 

grounded in the rule of law.

U.S. Establishes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile

•

•

•

A landmark executive order directs the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, consolidating 

all government-held BTC for long-term national stewardship—officially recognizing Bitcoin as a 

strategic asset.

Additionally, the executive order directs for the establishment of a separate U.S. Digital Asset 

Stockpile for other forfeited assets, introducing the first formal framework for digital asset custody and 

use at the federal level.

This move signals a historic shift: digital assets are now viewed as sovereign financial infrastructure—

validating the vision Coinbase is building toward.

Coinbase at the White House Crypto Summit

•

•

•

•

Crypto is no longer peripheral in Washington—it’s becoming part of the national economic agenda.

Coinbase joined industry leaders at the first White House-hosted crypto summit, focused on 

innovation, economic competitiveness, and responsible policy.

The tone was constructive and forward-looking, marking increased executive branch engagement with 

the crypto industry.

Coinbase emphasized the need for clear, consistent regulation—balancing consumer protection with 

innovation.

Advancing Clarity Through the Courts

•

•

In a major milestone, the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase was dismissed with prejudice.

On staking, five state actions were dropped, and Coinbase continues to seek dismissal of the 

remaining cases.

Legislative Momentum Accelerated, Though Headwinds Remain

•

•

Coinbase continues direct engagement with lawmakers—advocating for rules that accommodate both 

centralized platforms and decentralized protocols.

The tide is turning with the U.S. seeking to lead on crypto policy—and Coinbase is at the table to help 

make that happen.

Chapter 4

Q2’25 Outlook

Macro uncertainty, including around global trade policy, is impacting consumer sentiment and may contribute to 

softer crypto trading markets and lower asset prices as we enter the second quarter. We are very familiar with 

operating through uncertainty and are confident in our ability to maintain our long-term product roadmap and 

remain financially disciplined.

$700-$750 million

Including ~$15 million in stock-based compensation

In April, we generated approximately $240 million of transaction revenue. Our spot transaction volume was 

down approximately 12% month-over-month in April, similar to global spot volume which was down 

approximately 13% over the same time period. As always, we continue to urge caution in extrapolating these 

results.

Subscription and Services Revenue

We expect Q2 subscription and services revenue to be within $600-$680 million. We expect Q/Q growth in 

stablecoin revenue to be more than offset by a decline in blockchain revenue due to lower crypto asset prices. 

Q2-to-date, we have already observed ETH down 36% and SOL down 25% as compared to their Q1 average 

prices.

Expenses

We expect technology & development and general & administrative expenses to be between $700-$750 

million, reflecting current market volatility and lower variable costs such as infrastructure and customer support 

expenses (which are driven by activity on our platform) and seasonally lower payroll taxes. Expectations for 

lower variable expenses are partially offset by headcount growth, which we anticipate growing at a slightly 

higher rate in Q2 compared to Q1.

Sales and marketing expenses are expected to be in the range of $215-$315 million. We continue to monitor 

current market conditions and expect additional opportunities to continue to invest in marketing initiatives 

through the rest of the quarter. Where we fall within the range will largely be determined by 1) whether we 

continue to see attractive performance marketing opportunities throughout the remainder of Q2, which have 

historically largely correlated with market volatility and asset prices and 2) customer USDC balances in 

Coinbase products, which drive USDC rewards.

Webcast Information

We will host a conference call to discuss the results for the first quarter 2025 on May 8, 2025 at 2:30 pm PT. 

The live webcast of the call will be available at youtube.com/@coinbase/streams. A replay of the call, as well as 

a transcript, will be available on our Investor Relations website at investor.coinbase.com.

Forward-Looking Statements

This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 

1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are 

not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, including for the second quarter ending 

June 30, 2025; anticipated future expenses and investments; the expected timing for completion, benefits, and impacts of our 

proposed acquisition of Deribit; expectations relating to certain of our key financial and operating metrics; our business strategy 

and plans; expectations relating to legal and regulatory proceedings; expectations relating to our industry, the regulatory 

environment, market conditions, trends and growth; expectations relating to customer behaviors and preferences; our market 

position; potential market opportunities; and our objectives for future operations. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” 

“potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are 

intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, 

assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made. These forward-looking 

statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among others: our ability to successfully 

execute our business and growth strategy and generate future profitability; market acceptance of our products and services; our 

ability to further penetrate our existing customer base and expand our customer base; our ability to develop new products and 

services; our ability to expand internationally; failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals and satisfy other closing conditions 

in a timely manner or otherwise for any acquisition we make, including Deribit; the success of any acquisitions or investments that 

we make; the effects of increased competition in our markets; our ability to stay in compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations; stock price fluctuations; market conditions across the cryptoeconomy, including crypto asset price volatility; and 

general market, political, and economic conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, inflation, tariffs, instability in the global 

banking system, economic downturns, and other global events, including regional wars and conflicts and government shutdowns. 

It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent 

to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-

looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, our actual results could differ materially 

and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause 

actual results to differ materially from forecasted results are, or will be included, in our filings we make with the Securities and 

Exchange Commission (SEC) from time to time, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 

2025 filed with the SEC on May 8, 2025. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking 

statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance 

measure, is useful information to help investors evaluate our operating performance because it: enables investors to compare 

this measure and component adjustments to similar information provided by peer companies and our past financial performance; 

provides additional company-specific adjustments for certain items that may be included in income from operations but that we do 

not consider to be normal, recurring, operating expenses (or income) necessary to operate our business given our operations, 

revenue generating activities, business strategy, industry, and regulatory environment; and provides investors with visibility to a 

measure management uses to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. For example:

• We believe it is useful to exclude certain non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based 

compensation, from Adjusted EBITDA because the amounts of such expenses can vary significantly from period to 

period and may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.

• We believe it is useful to exclude certain items that we do not consider to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses 

and therefore, not reflective of our ongoing business operations. For example, we exclude: (i) other (income) expense, 

net, as the income and expenses recognized in this line item are not part of our core operating activities and are 

considered non-operating activities under GAAP, and (ii) gains and losses on crypto assets held for investment because 

such investments are considered primarily long-term holdings. We do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto 

assets, and, as an operating company, our investing activities in crypto are not part of our revenue generating activities, 

which are based on transactions on our platform and the sales of subscriptions and services.

• We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as 

stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, 

net, and benefit from or provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending 

upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income 

per Share, both non-GAAP financial performance measures, are useful information to help investors evaluate our operating 

performance. We believe it is useful to exclude tax-effected gains and losses on crypto assets held for investment from both 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share because (i) such investments are considered primarily long-term 

holdings, (ii) we do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets, and, (iii) as an operating company, our investing 

activities in crypto are not part of our revenue generating activities, which are based on transactions on our platform and the sales 

of subscriptions and services.

Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors for the reasons noted above. However, non-GAAP 

financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools, and should 

not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other 

companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other 

measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our disclosure of non-GAAP financial 

measures as a tool for comparison. 

Adjusted EBITDA

There are a number of limitations related to Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent of 

Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA excludes:

•

provision for (benefit from) income taxes;

13

•

•

•

•

•

interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which 

reduces cash available to us;

depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and 

amortized may have to be replaced in the future;

stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant 

recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

net gains or losses on our crypto assets held for investment, net;

other (income) expense, net, which represents losses or gains on other financial instruments, and other non-operating 

income and expense activity.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share

There are limitations related to Adjusted Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share rather than net income and net 

income per share, which are the nearest GAAP equivalents, respectively, including that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net 

Income per share each exclude tax-effected gains and losses on crypto assets held for investment.

Additional Information

For more information, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents, please 

see  the  reconciliation  of  GAAP  to  non-GAAP  results  tables  in  this  shareholder  letter.  Investors  are  encouraged  to  review  the 

related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
