Table of Contents

You  should  not  rely  upon  forward-looking  statements  as  predictions  of  future  events.  We  have  based  the  forward-looking  statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may
affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  and  prospects.  The  outcome  of  the  events  described  in  these  forward-looking
statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of
this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  and  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q.  Moreover,  we  operate  in  a  very  competitive  and
rapidly  changing  environment.  New  risks  and  uncertainties  emerge  from  time  to  time  and  it  is  not  possible  for  us  to  predict  all  risks  and
uncertainties that could have an impact on any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure
you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events,
or circumstances could differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements.

Neither  we  nor  any  other  person  assume  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  any  of  these  forward-looking  statements.
Moreover,  the  forward-looking  statements  made  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  relate  only  to  events  as  of  the  date  on  which  the
statements  are  made.  We  undertake  no  obligation  to  update  any  forward-looking  statements  made  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  to
reflect  events  or  circumstances  after  the  date  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  or  to  reflect  new  information  or  the  occurrence  of
unanticipated  events,  except  as  required  by  law.  We  may  not  actually  achieve  the  plans,  intentions  or  expectations  disclosed  in  our  forward-
looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect
the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, restructurings, joint ventures, partnerships, or investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements
are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a
reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we
have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain,
and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

RISK FACTORS SUMMARY

Consistent with the foregoing, our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length below.

These risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks:

• Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto;

• Our  total  revenue  is  substantially  dependent  on  the  prices  of  crypto  assets  and  volume  of  transactions  conducted  on  our  platform.  If
such price or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected and the price of our
Class A common stock could decline;

• Our net revenue may be concentrated in a limited number of areas. Within transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue, a
meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC, respectively. If
revenue from these areas declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets or other products and services, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected;

• We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties.
If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining strategic relationships with these third parties or if these third parties fail to deliver
certain operational services, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected;

•

Interest rate fluctuations could negatively impact us;

•

•

•

Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our business;

The future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If crypto does not
grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected;

Cyberattacks and security breaches of our platform, or those impacting our customers or third parties, could adversely affect our brand,
reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition;

• We are subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply

with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition;

• We  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  industry  and  we  compete  against  unregulated  or  less  regulated  companies  and  companies  with
greater financial and other resources, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are
unable to compete effectively;

• We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business, operating results, and financial

condition could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively;

•

As we continue to expand and localize our international activities, our obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies
of a variety of jurisdictions will increase and we may be subject to inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions by U.S. and non-
U.S. regulators and governmental authorities, including those related to sanctions, export control, and anti-money laundering;

• We are, and may continue to be, subject to material litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits, as well as investigations and
enforcement  actions  by  regulators  and  governmental  authorities.  These  matters  are  often  expensive  and  time  consuming,  and,  if
resolved adversely, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition;

•

•

If we cannot keep pace with rapid industry changes to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and
services, and consequently our net revenue, could decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition;

A particular crypto asset, product or service’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty
and  if  we  are  unable  to  properly  characterize  a  crypto  asset  or  product  offering,  we  may  be  subject  to  regulatory  scrutiny,  inquiries,
investigations, fines, and other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition;

• We  currently  rely  on  third-party  service  providers  for  certain  aspects  of  our  operations,  and  any  interruptions  in  services  provided  by

these third parties may impair our ability to support our customers;

•

•

Loss  of  a  critical  financial  institution  or  insurance  relationship  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition;

Any significant disruption in our products and services, in our information technology systems, or in any of the blockchain networks we
support, could result in a loss of customers or funds and adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial
condition;

• Our failure to securely store and manage our and our customers’ fiat currencies and crypto assets could adversely affect our business,

operating results, and financial condition; and

•

The  theft,  loss,  or  destruction  of  private  keys  required  to  access  any  crypto  assets  held  in  custody  for  our  own  account  or  for  our
customers may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our
ability to access any crypto assets, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses.

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Coinbase Global, Inc.

(unaudited)

Coinbase, Inc. was founded in 2012. In April 2014, in connection with a corporate reorganization, Coinbase, Inc. became a wholly-owned

subsidiary of Coinbase Global, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”).

The Company provides a trusted platform that serves as a compliant on-ramp to the onchain economy and enables users to engage in a
wide  variety  of  activities  with  their  crypto  assets  in  both  proprietary  and  third-party  product  experiences  enabled  by  access  to  decentralized
applications.  The  Company  offers  (i)  consumers  their  primary  financial  account  for  the  cryptoeconomy,  (ii)  institutions  a  full-service  prime
brokerage platform with access to deep pools of liquidity across the crypto marketplace, and (iii) developers a suite of products granting access
to build onchain.

The Company is remote-first and accordingly, does not maintain a headquarters. Substantially all of the Company’s executive team meetings
are  held  virtually,  with  meetings  occasionally  held  in-person  at  locations  that  are  either  not  in  the  Company’s  offices  or  in  various  of  the
Company’s offices distributed around the world. The Company holds all of its stockholder meetings virtually.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation and preparation

The  accompanying  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  –  entities  in
which the Company holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights, or where it exercises control. The Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements are unaudited but have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) on the same basis as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and in management’s opinion, reflect all adjustments, consisting
only  of  normal,  recurring  adjustments,  that  are  necessary  for  the  fair  presentation  of  the  Company’s  Financial  Statements.  Preparation  of  the
Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  in  the
Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  notes  thereto.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  period’s  presentation.  The  unaudited  Condensed  Consolidated  Results  of
Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other
period  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  audited  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in  the  Company’s
Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2024  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  “SEC”)  on
February 13, 2025 (the “Annual Report”).

There  were  no  material  changes  to  the  Company’s  most  significant  estimates  and  assumptions,  significant  accounting  policies,  segment
reporting, or recent accounting pronouncements that were disclosed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in the Annual Report, other than as discussed below.

Concentration of credit risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, customer custodial funds, USDC, loan receivables, certain
crypto  assets  held,  accounts  receivable,  and  deposits  are  potentially  subject  to  concentration  of  credit  risk.  See  below  and  Notes  4.
Collateralized  Arrangements  and  Financing  and  6.  Accounts  Receivable,  Net  for  a  discussion  of  these  risks  by  counterparty  and  type  of
transaction.

Funds held at financial institutions

Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  customer  custodial  funds  are  primarily  placed  with  financial

institutions which are of high credit quality. The Company holds cash and

10

(unaudited)

cash equivalents and customer custodial funds primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. The Company may also
have corporate deposit balances with financial institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000.
The  Company  has  not  experienced  losses  on  these  accounts  and  does  not  believe  it  is  exposed  to  any  significant  credit  risk  with  respect  to
these accounts.

Funds held at trading venues, payment processors, and clearing brokers

The Company holds cash, restricted cash and deposits, and crypto assets at crypto asset trading venues, payment processors, and clearing
brokers, and performs a regular assessment of these venues as part of its risk management process. As of March 31, 2025, the Company held
$231.6  million  at  these  venues,  including  $135.5  million  in  cash,  $62.9  million  in  crypto  assets,  and  $31.0  million  in  restricted  cash.  As  of
December 31, 2024, the Company held $88.2 million in cash at these venues.

USDC

The  Company  holds  USDC,  a  stablecoin  redeemable  on  a  one-to-one  basis  for  U.S.  dollars  and  issued  by  Circle  Internet  Financial,  LLC
(“Circle”) and its affiliate, Circle Internet Financial Europe SAS. USDC is accounted for as a financial instrument in the Condensed Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  Circle  reported  that,  as  of  March  31,  2025,  underlying  reserves  were  held  in  cash,  short-duration  U.S. Treasuries,  and
overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements within segregated accounts for the benefit of USDC holders.

The Company has valued all Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted market prices for the

underlying crypto assets as an observable input.

Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis

The Company’s non-financial assets, such as software and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are adjusted to fair value when

an impairment charge is recognized.

The Company’s strategic investments are nearly all accounted for using the measurement alternative, whereby they are recognized at cost
and adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment, on a non-recurring
basis.  Fair  value  measurements  for  strategic  investments  are  based  predominantly  on  Level  3  inputs  to  an  Option-Pricing  Model  that  uses
publicly available market data of comparable companies and other unobservable inputs including expected volatility, expected time to liquidity,
adjustments for other company-specific developments, and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds.

The impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from remeasurement of measurement alternative investments was
immaterial for all periods presented, as were cumulative upward adjustments of measurement alternative investments outstanding at March 31,
2025 and December 31, 2024. Cumulative impairments and downward adjustments as of these dates were $120.7 million and $145.8 million,
respectively.  See  Note  10.  Other  Condensed  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  Details  for  the  carrying  amount  of  the  Company’s  strategic
investments.

Assets and liabilities not measured and recorded at fair value

Certain of the Company’s financial instruments are not measured and recorded at fair value because carrying values of these instruments
approximate  their  fair  values  due  to  their  liquid  or  short-term  nature.  The  following  financial  instruments  denominated  in  fiat  or  USDC,  as
applicable,  would  be  based  on  Level  1  valuation  inputs  if  they  were  recorded  at  fair  value:  cash,  restricted  cash,  USDC,  certain  customer
custodial funds and related liabilities, collateral pledged, and obligations to return collateral. The following financial instruments denominated in
fiat  or  USDC,  as  applicable,  would  be  based  on  Level  2  valuation  inputs  if  they  were  recorded  at  fair  value:  accounts  receivable,  loan
receivables, accounts payable, and long-term debt.

The Company’s long-term debt is not measured and recorded at fair value. See Note 8. Long-Term Debt for the estimated fair value of the

Company’s long-term debt.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company calculated the tax provision using a discrete effective tax rate method.
The Company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was 20.4% and 18.2%, respectively. The ETR of
20.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the Company’s deductible
stock-based compensation, mostly offset by non-deductible expenses, state tax, and tax on foreign operations.

As of March 31, 2025, the Company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $995.5 million, compared to $941.3 million as of December 31,
2024.  As  of  each  reporting  date,  management  considers  new  evidence,  both  positive  and  negative,  that  could  affect  its  view  of  the  future
realization of deferred tax assets. Management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that
the Company’s net deferred tax asset will be fully realized.

The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical,
except with respect to voting. As a result, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting income or loss per
share will, therefore, be the same for both Class A common stock and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.

The following potentially dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect would have been anti-

The Company is obligated to securely store all crypto assets and USDC that it holds in custodial products on behalf of customers. As such,

the Company may be liable to its users for losses arising from

21

Table of Contents

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Coinbase Global, Inc.

(unaudited)

the  Company’s  failure  to  secure  these  assets  from  theft  or  loss.  The  Company  has  not  incurred  any  losses  related  to  such  obligations  and
therefore has not accrued any liabilities as of each March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Company holds crypto assets and USDC in
custodial  products  on  its  platform  on  behalf  of  its  customers  totaling  $327.5  billion  and  $404.0  billion  at  fair  value  at  March  31,  2025  and
December 31, 2024, respectively. These assets are not recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Similarly, as the Company
has an obligation to securely store all of these assets, it has a corresponding unrecognized liability of $327.5 billion and $404.0 billion at March
31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Since the risk of loss is remote, the Company did not recognize a contingent liability at March
31, 2025 or December 31, 2024. The Company has no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability because
(i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of
crypto assets within its control, and (iii) it has established security around custodial product private keys to minimize the risk of theft or loss.

Indemnifications

In  the  event  any  registrable  securities  are  included  in  a  registration  statement,  the  Company’s Amended  and  Restated  Investors’  Rights
Agreement (the “IRA”) entered into with certain of the Company’s stockholders provides indemnity to each stockholder, their partners, members,
officers, directors, and stockholders and certain of their advisors; each underwriter, if any; and each person who controls each stockholder or
underwriter,  against  any  damages  incurred  in  connection  with  investigating  or  defending  any  claim  or  proceeding  arising  as  a  result  of  such
registration  from  which  damages  may  result. The  Company  will  reimburse  each  such  party  for  any  legal  and  any  other  expenses  reasonably
incurred, provided that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent the damages arise out of or are based upon any actions or
omissions  made  in  reliance  upon  and  in  conformity  with  written  information  furnished  by  or  on  behalf  of  such  stockholder  or  underwriter  and
stated to be specifically for use therein.

The  Company  also  has  indemnity  agreements  with  certain  officers  and  directors  of  the  Company  pursuant  to  which  the  Company  must
indemnify the officer or director against all expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred in connection with a
third party proceeding, if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Company, and in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.

It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  exposure  under  these  indemnification  agreements:  (i)  because  the  facts  and
circumstances involved in each claim are unique and the Company cannot predict the number or nature of claims that may be made; (ii) due to
the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement; and (iii) due to the requirement for a registration of the Company’s
securities before any of the indemnification obligations contemplated in the IRA become effective.

The Company has also provided indemnities or similar commitments on standard commercial terms in the ordinary course of business.

Legal and regulatory proceedings

The Company is subject to various litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
business.  The  Company  is  also  subject  to  regulatory  oversight  by  numerous  regulatory  and  other  governmental  agencies,  including  at  the
federal  and  state  levels  and  internationally.  The  Company  reviews  its  lawsuits,  regulatory  investigations,  and  other  legal  proceedings  on  an
ongoing  basis  and  provides  disclosure  and  recognizes  loss  contingencies  in  accordance  with  the  loss  contingencies  accounting  guidance.  In
accordance  with  such  guidance,  the  Company  establishes  accruals  for  such  matters  when  potential  losses  become  probable  and  can  be
reasonably estimated. If the

22

Company determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss
in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July and August 2021, three purported securities class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
against  the  Company,  its  directors,  certain  of  its  officers  and  employees,  and  certain  venture  capital  and  investment  firms.  The  complaints
alleged  violations  of  Sections  11,  12(a)(2)  and  15  of  the  Securities Act,  in  connection  with  the  registration  statement  and  prospectus  filed  in
connection  with  the  Direct  Listing.  In  November  2021,  these  actions  were  consolidated  and  recaptioned  as  In  re  Coinbase  Global  Securities
Litigation,  and  an  amended  complaint  was  filed. The  plaintiff  sought,  among  other  relief,  unspecified  compensatory  damages,  attorneys’  fees,
and costs. The Company disputed the claims and vigorously defended against them. In March 2025, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this action
and the court entered an order closing the case. The resolution of this action did not have a material impact on the Company’s business and
financial statements. The Company has subsequently received, and expects to receive in the future, similar shareholder claims.

In October 2021, a purported class action captioned Underwood et al. v. Coinbase Global, Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging claims under Sections 5, 15(a)(1) and 29(b) of the Exchange
Act, and violations of certain California and Florida state statutes. On March 11, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Coinbase,
Inc.  and  Brian  Armstrong  as  defendants  and  adding  causes  of  action,  including  alleging  claims  under  Sections  5,  12(a)(1)  and  15  of  the
Securities Act and violations of certain New Jersey state statutes. Among other relief requested, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, unspecified
damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 1, 2023, the District Court dismissed all federal claims (with prejudice) and state law claims
(without  prejudice)  against  Coinbase  Global,  Inc.,  Coinbase,  Inc.  and  Brian  Armstrong.  Subsequently,  on  February  9,  2023,  the  plaintiffs
appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”), and the parties completed briefing the appeal on
September  13,  2023.  Oral  argument  took  place  on  February  1,  2024  and  on  April  5,  2024,  the  Court  of  Appeals  issued  a  Summary  Order
affirming the District Court’s dismissal order with respect to the claims alleging violations of the Exchange Act, and reversing the District Court’s
dismissal  order  with  respect  to  the  claims  alleging  violations  of  the  Securities  Act  and  violations  of  the  state  statutes.  On  June  27,  2024,
defendants  filed  an  answer  to  the  amended  complaint,  and  on  July  29,  2024,  the  defendants  filed  a  Motion  for  Judgment  on  the  Pleadings
requesting the District Court dismiss the remaining claims. On February 7, 2025, the District Court denied defendants’ Motion for Judgement on
the  Pleadings  and  allowed  the  case  to  proceed  to  bifurcated  discovery,  followed  by  summary  judgment  motions.  The  defendants  continue  to
dispute the claims in this case and intend to vigorously defend against them. Based on the nature of the proceedings in this case, the outcome of
this matter remains uncertain and the Company cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.
The Company has subsequently received, and expects to receive in the future, similar class action claims.

In  December  2021,  a  shareholder  derivative  suit  captioned  Shin  v.  Coinbase  Global,  Inc.,  was  filed  in  New  York  state  court  against  the
Company  and  its  directors,  alleging  breach  of  fiduciary  duties,  unjust  enrichment,  abuse  of  control,  gross  mismanagement,  and  waste  of
corporate assets, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company has subsequently received, and expects to receive in
the future, similar derivative claims. The Company disputes the claims in these cases and intends to vigorously defend against them. Based on
the preliminary nature of the proceedings in these cases, the outcome of these matters remain uncertain and the Company cannot estimate the
potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.

In June 2023, the SEC filed a complaint in the District Court against the Company and Coinbase, Inc. alleging that Coinbase, Inc. acted as
an  unregistered  securities  exchange,  broker,  and  clearing  agency  in  violation  of  Sections  5,  15(a)  and  17A(b)  of  the  Exchange Act  and  that,
through its staking program, Coinbase, Inc. offered and sold securities without registering its offers and sales in violation of Sections 5(a) and
5(c) of the Securities Act. The SEC also alleged that the Company is liable for the alleged violations as an alleged control person of Coinbase,
Inc. The case was captioned SEC v. Coinbase, Inc.

et al. The SEC sought, among other relief, injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil money penalties. The Company and Coinbase, Inc. filed an
answer  to  the  SEC  complaint  in  June  2023,  disputed  the  claims  in  the  case,  and  vigorously  defended  against  them.  On August  4,  2023,  the
Company and Coinbase, Inc. filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The SEC filed its response on October 3, 2023 and the Company and
Coinbase,  Inc.  filed  their  reply  on  October  24,  2023.  Oral  argument  took  place  on  January  17,  2024.  On  March  27,  2024,  the  District  Court
denied  in  part  the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.’s  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings  with  respect  to  the  SEC’s  claims  that  Coinbase,  Inc.
operated  as  an  unregistered  securities  exchange,  broker,  and  clearing  agency  and  engaged  in  an  unregistered  offer  and  sale  of  securities
through  the  Company’s  staking  program.  The  District  Court  dismissed  the  SEC’s  claim  that  Coinbase,  Inc.  acted  as  an  unregistered  broker
through its wallet service. On April 12, 2024, the Company and Coinbase, Inc. filed a motion with the District Court seeking certification of an
interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals. The District Court granted that motion on January 7, 2025 and stayed proceedings in the District
Court. On January 17, 2025, the Company and Coinbase, Inc. filed a petition for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeals. On February 28,
2025, the SEC and the Company and Coinbase, Inc. jointly stipulated to dismissal of SEC v. Coinbase, Inc. et al. with prejudice. The case is now
concluded. The resolution of the SEC’s lawsuit did not have a material impact on the Company’s business and financial statements.

In  June  2023,  the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.  were  issued  notices,  show-cause  orders,  and  cease-and-desist  letters,  and  became  the
subject of various legal actions initiated by U.S. state securities regulators in the states of Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New
Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin alleging violations of state securities laws with respect to staking services provided
by  Coinbase,  Inc.  In  July  2023,  the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.  entered  into  agreements  with  state  securities  regulators  in  California,  New
Jersey,  South  Carolina  and  Wisconsin,  pursuant  to  which  customers  in  those  states  will  no  longer  be  able  to  stake  new  funds,  in  each  case
pending final adjudication of the matters. In October 2023, the Company and Coinbase, Inc. entered into a similar agreement with the Maryland
state  securities  regulator.  In  March  and  April  2025,  the  Alabama,  Kentucky,  Illinois,  South  Carolina,  and  Vermont  state  securities  regulators
dismissed, vacated, rescinded, and/or withdrew their legal actions. The Company and Coinbase, Inc. dispute the claims of the state securities
regulators and intend to vigorously defend against them. Based on the preliminary nature of these actions, the final outcome of these matters
remains  uncertain  and  the  Company  cannot  estimate  the  potential  impact  on  its  business  or  financial  statements  at  this  time.  An  adverse
resolution in these state matters could have a material impact on the Company’s business and financial statements.

The  Company  has,  from  time  to  time,  received  investigative  subpoenas  and  requests  from  regulators  for  documents  and  information,
including about certain customer programs, operations, and existing and intended future products, including the Company’s processes for listing
assets, the classification of certain listed assets, its staking programs, and its stablecoin and yield-generating products.

Except as otherwise disclosed, the Company believes the ultimate resolution of existing legal and regulatory investigation matters will not
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows  of  the  Company.  However,  in  light  of  the
uncertainties inherent in these matters, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations for a particular period, and future changes in circumstances or additional information could result
in  additional  accruals  or  resolution  in  excess  of  established  accruals,  which  could  adversely  affect  the  Company’s  results  of  operations,

Current tax rules related to crypto assets are evolving and require significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the law, including but
not limited to the areas of income tax, information reporting, value added taxes, digital services tax, transaction level taxes and the withholding of
tax at source. Further, it is possible that additional legislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. governing bodies that may differ
significantly from the Company's practices or interpretation of the law, which could have unforeseen effects on the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations, and accordingly, the

Company is unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond amounts already accrued. As a result, the Company
may have exposure to additional tax liabilities that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results and financial condition.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  the  accompanying  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  and  our
Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2024  (the  “Annual  Report”).  The  following  discussion  and  analysis  contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could
cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the
Company,” and “Coinbase” refer to Coinbase Global, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. For all narrative provided in this Item 2, two numbers
presented  consecutively  represent  figures  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2025  as  compared  to  the  corresponding  period  in  2024,
respectively, unless otherwise noted.

Executive Overview

This  executive  overview  of  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  highlights  selected

information and does not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

26

Table of Contents

During the first quarter of 2025, we continued to make progress against our mission by launching advanced trading tools, scaling derivatives
globally,  and  growing  our  institutional  and  consumer  user  base.  We  also  expanded  access  to  financial  services  and  implemented  key
infrastructure updates by upgrading Base to support the next generation of onchain apps and driving stablecoin adoption at scale, both of which
are key to expanding global crypto usage.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our net revenue was $2.0 billion, including $1.3 billion in transaction revenue and $0.7 billion in
subscription  and  services  revenue.  For  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2024,  our  net  revenue  was  $1.6  billion,  including  $1.1  billion  in
transaction revenue and $0.5 billion in subscription and services revenue.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our net income was $65.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $0.9 billion. For the three months

ended March 31, 2024, our net income was $1.2 billion and Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion.

Despite  multiple  Federal  Funds  Rate  decreases  in  late  2024,  future  interest  rate  decreases  are  not  certain.  If  interest  rates  continue  to
decline, they may materially impact our subscription and services and other revenue. We plan to dynamically adjust our expense base in order to
be responsive to market conditions and revenue opportunities, increasing or decreasing it as needed, especially with respect to certain variable
expenses.  In  the  second  quarter  of  2025,  we  expect  technology  and  development  and  general  and  administrative  expenses  to  decline  as
compared to the first quarter of 2025, driven by lower variable customer support expenses and seasonally lower payroll taxes. Additionally, we
expect  sales  and  marketing  expenses  to  grow  modestly,  as  compared  to  the  first  quarter  of  2025,  primarily  due  to  expected  higher  USDC
rewards expense and brand marketing spend seasonality.

(3) See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and an explanation for why we consider Adjusted EBITDA to

Monthly Transacting Users

We define a Monthly Transacting User (“MTU”) as a consumer who actively or passively transacts in one or more products on our platform at
least  once  during  the  rolling  28-day  period  ending  on  the  date  of  measurement.  MTUs  engage  in  transactions  that  generate  both  transaction
revenue and subscription and services revenue. Revenue-generating transactions include active transactions, such as buying or selling crypto
assets or passive transactions such as earning staking rewards and USDC rewards. MTUs also engage in transactions that are non-revenue
generating, such as consumers sending and receiving crypto assets between wallets and off-platform accounts on a non-expedited basis. MTUs
may overstate the number of unique consumers due to differences in product architecture or user behavior.

27

Table of Contents

MTUs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to an increase in trading users, influenced

by overall crypto market sentiment and activity, including higher average prices for certain crypto assets.

Assets on Platform

We define Assets on Platform (“AOP”) as the total United States (“U.S.”) dollar equivalent value of USDC and crypto assets held or managed
on behalf of customers in digital wallets on our platform, including our custody services but excluding assets for which the customer holds full or
partial keys, calculated based on the market price on the date of measurement. AOP demonstrates the scale of balances held across our suite of
products and services, the trust customers place in us to securely store their assets, and the underlying growth of the cryptoeconomy. AOP also
represents  a  monetization  opportunity  through  our  products  and  services,  including  from  trading  and  the  adoption  and  use  of  USDC,  staking,
custody, and Prime Financing, when customers use these assets to engage with these products and services.

The following table sets forth the value of AOP by asset (in thousands, except percentages):

AOP at March 31, 2025 remained relatively flat as compared to March 31, 2024, reflecting increases of $37.9 billion due to higher Bitcoin
units on platform and $24.7 billion due to increases in the price of Bitcoin, largely offset by the impact of net decreases in the prices of Ethereum
and  other  crypto  assets.  Separately,  we  attribute  the  growth  in  USDC AOP  primarily  to  our  USDC  rewards  program,  combined  with  deeper
integration of USDC across our products.

Trading Volume

We define Trading Volume as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of spot matched trades transacted between a buyer and seller through
our platform during the period of measurement. Trading Volume does not include derivatives volume on our platform or trades executed on third-
party  venues. Trading  Volume  represents  the  product  of  the  quantity  of  assets  transacted  and  the  trade  price  at  the  time  the  transaction  was
executed. As trading activity directly impacts transaction revenue, we believe this measure is a reflection of liquidity on our order books, trading
health, and the underlying growth of the cryptoeconomy. Institutions incur lower fees per transaction than consumers and, as a result, the impact
of changes in consumer Trading Volume on transaction revenue is more pronounced than the impact of changes in institutional Trading Volume.

Generally, Trading Volume on our platform is primarily influenced by overall market dynamics, namely the price of crypto assets, crypto asset
volatility, and macroeconomic conditions, and by our share of total crypto market spot trading volume. In periods of high crypto asset prices and
crypto asset volatility, we have experienced correspondingly high levels of Trading Volume.

Includes various other crypto asset balances, none of which individually represented more than 10% of our total Trading Volume.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, Trading Volume increased reflecting an increase in both the total market

and our market share in the U.S., where our business is concentrated:

•

Total market — Crypto Asset Volatility  increased 15% and average total crypto market capitalization increased 56%. These two macro
inputs  have  historically  been  highly  correlated  with  Trading  Volume  and  are  typically  influenced  by  overall  crypto  market  sentiment,
activity in the crypto market, and changes in average crypto asset prices; and

1

• Market  share  —  Trading  Volume  growth  outpaced  the  17%  growth  in  overall  U.S.  spot  market  trading  volume,  as  we  were  able  to

capture a larger portion of the trading activity due to our competitive position and product strategy.

1

  Crypto Asset  Volatility  represents  our  internal  measure  of  crypto  asset  volatility  in  the  market  relative  to  prior  periods.  The  volatility  is  based  on  intraday  returns  of  a  volume-
weighted basket of all assets listed on our trading platform. These returns are used to compute the basket’s intraday volatility which is then scaled to a daily window. These daily
volatility values are then averaged over the applicable time period as needed.

Transaction revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, due to:

•

•

•

an increase in consumer transaction revenue of $366.5 million due to a 39% increase in consumer Trading Volume. This increase was
offset  in  part  by  a  decrease  of  $206.2  million  attributed  to  a  lower  average  blended  fee  rate,  primarily  due  to  changes  in  the  mix  of
Trading Volume from Simple to Advanced trading, as well as growth in Trading Volume from Coinbase One users.

an increase in institutional transaction revenue primarily driven by growth in derivatives trading volume on our international exchange.
Separately,  the  impact  of  a  23%  increase  in  institutional  Trading  Volume  was  offset  by  a  lower  average  blended  fee  rate  resulting
primarily from reduced fees at higher volumes; and

an increase in other transaction revenue primarily driven by higher revenue from instant transfer withdrawals.

Subscription and services revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to:

•

increases in stablecoin revenue of $105.1 million due to higher average USDC balances held in Coinbase products , on which we earn
the  vast  majority  of  the  interest  on  the  associated  reserves,  and  $67.9  million  due  to  higher  average  USDC  off-platform  balances,  on
which we earn varying percentages depending on where the USDC is held. This revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease of
$68.5 million due to lower average interest rates, which declined 96 basis points;

•

•

an increase in blockchain rewards of $20.5 million due to changes in average crypto asset prices, and $13.9 million due to changes in
reward rates primarily for Solana and Ethereum; and

an  increase  in  other  subscription  and  services  revenue,  primarily  due  to  growth  of  Coinbase  One,  reflecting  a  higher  number  of  paid

•

•

•

•

•

higher  blockchain  rewards  fees,  which  rose  with  blockchain  rewards  revenue,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  adjustments  to  our  fee
structures;

an  increase  in  payment  processing  fees  of  $18.7  million,  due  to  26%  Trading  Volume  growth  and  expanding  international  payment
methods. Account verification fees also rose with more new users verified;

higher  transaction  rebates  and  commissions,  primarily  reflecting  an  increase  in  rebates  earned  by  institutional  customers  providing
liquidity on our international exchange, driven by growth in volume; and

an increase in transaction reversal losses primarily driven by higher transaction volume; offset in part by

a decrease in blockchain transaction fees primarily due to lower average gas and asset prices for Ethereum.

There were no material changes to note within other.

Technology and development expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to:

•

a decrease in personnel-related expenses reflecting:

◦

◦

◦

◦

$20.5  million  lower  stock-based  compensation  expense  attributed  to  the  roll-off  of  non-recurring  multi-year  stock-based
compensation awards;

$17.3 million higher capitalization of costs of internally developed technology; and

a $10.3 million decrease due to updates made in late 2024 to our vesting schedule for new awards to achieve linear expense
recognition; offset in part by

$15.6 million higher personnel-related expenses due to higher average headcount.

•

an increase in website hosting and infrastructure expenses driven by increased activity on our platform.

There were no material changes to note within amortization, depreciation, and impairment or other.

Sales and marketing expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to:

•

•

an increase in marketing program expenses due to higher digital advertising spend as we capitalized on market momentum during the
quarter; and

an increase in USDC rewards payouts of $53.2 million primarily due to growth in average customer USDC balances held in Coinbase
products ,  with  the  remainder  primarily  due  to  higher  reward  rates  offered  to  customers  in  an  effort  to  enhance  customer  acquisition,
retention, and platform engagement.

(1) Excludes personnel-related and professional services expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to:

•

•

•

an increase in customer support costs as a result of increased capacity needs. Our capacity needs typically increase in periods following
higher Trading Volumes;

an increase in professional services primarily due to higher costs of legal advisory services; and

a $27.8 million increase in policy spend within other as we increased our crypto advocacy efforts, offset in part by a decrease of $20.1
million in legal costs. The remaining variance in other was due to increases across various expenses, with no material changes to note.

There were no material changes to note within personnel-related.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024, the decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily due to lower

pretax income, partially offset by lower tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure, is
useful information to help investors evaluate our operating performance because it: enables investors to compare this measure and component
adjustments  to  similar  information  provided  by  peer  companies  and  our  past  financial  performance;  provides  additional  company-specific
adjustments  for  certain  items  that  may  be  included  in  income  from  operations  but  that  we  do  not  consider  to  be  normal,  recurring,  operating
expenses  (or  income)  necessary  to  operate  our  business  given  our  operations,  revenue  generating  activities,  business  strategy,  industry,  and
regulatory environment; and provides investors with visibility to a measure management uses to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal
planning and forecasting purposes. For example:

• We  believe  it  is  useful  to  exclude  certain  non-cash  expenses,  such  as  depreciation  and  amortization  and  stock-based  compensation,
from Adjusted EBITDA because the amounts of such expenses can vary significantly from period to period and may not directly correlate
to the underlying performance of our business operations.

35

Table of Contents

• We believe it is useful to exclude certain items that we do not consider to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses and therefore,
not  reflective  of  our  ongoing  business  operations.  For  example,  we  exclude:  (i)  other  (income)  expense,  net,  as  the  income  and
expenses  recognized  in  this  line  item  are  not  part  of  our  core  operating  activities  and  are  considered  non-operating  activities  under
GAAP  and  (ii)  gains  and  losses  on  crypto  assets  held  for  investment  because  such  investments  are  considered  primarily  long-term
holdings. We do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets, and, as an operating company, our investing activities in crypto
are  not  part  of  our  revenue  generating  activities,  which  are  based  on  transactions  on  our  platform  and  the  sales  of  subscriptions  and
services.

• We  believe Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  to  measure  a  company’s  operating  performance  without  regard  to  items  such  as  stock-based
compensation  expense,  depreciation  and  amortization  expense,  interest  expense,  other  expense  (income),  net,  and  benefit  from  or
provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and
the method by which assets were acquired.

Limitations of Adjusted EBITDA

We  believe  that Adjusted  EBITDA  may  be  helpful  to  investors  for  the  reasons  noted  above.  However, Adjusted  EBITDA  is  presented  for
supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income
(loss), which is the nearest GAAP equivalent of Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA excludes:

•

•

•

•

•

•

provision for income taxes;

interest  expense,  or  the  cash  requirements  necessary  to  service  interest  or  principal  payments  on  our  debt,  which  reduces  cash
available to us;

depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may
have to be replaced in the future;

stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense
for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

net gains or losses on our crypto assets held for investment; and

other  expense  (income),  net,  which  represents  losses  or  gains  on  other  financial  instruments,  and  other  non-operating  income  and
expense activity.

In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or may use other measures to
evaluate  their  performance,  all  of  which  could  reduce  the  usefulness  of  our  disclosure  of  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  a  tool  for  comparison.  A
reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with
GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, and not
to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  our  liquidity  and  capital  resources  from  those  presented  in  the Annual  Report,  other  than  those

described below.

We  continue  to  believe  our  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  USDC  will  be  sufficient  in  both  the  short  and  long  term  to  meet  our
requirements  and  plans  for  cash,  including  meeting  our  working  capital  and  capital  expenditure  requirements.  Our  ability  to  meet  our
requirements  and  plans  for  cash,  including  meeting  our  working  capital  and  capital  expenditure  requirements,  will  depend  on  many  factors,
including market acceptance of crypto assets and blockchain technology, our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers on our platform,
the  continuing  market  acceptance  of  our  products  and  services,  the  introduction  of  new  subscription  products  and  services  on  our  platform,
expansion of sales and marketing activities, and overall economic conditions. We anticipate satisfying our short-term cash requirements with our
existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  USDC  and  with  future  cash  flows  from  operations  and  may  satisfy  our  long-term  cash  requirements
additionally  with  proceeds  from  a  future  equity  or  debt  financing.  The  sale  of  additional  equity  would  result  in  additional  dilution  to  our
stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could
provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.

Long-term debt and other contractual obligations

There have been no material changes in our long-term debt and other contractual obligations since those presented in the Annual Report. As

of March 31, 2025, our primary contractual obligation remained long-term debt, of which we held $4.3 billion in aggregate principal amount.

Crypto assets

We hold and use crypto assets for various purposes. Crypto assets held for operations are received in the ordinary course of business and
are converted to cash or used to fulfill expenses, primarily blockchain rewards, nearly immediately. In order to facilitate Prime Financing, we hold
crypto  assets  we  borrow,  as  well  as  crypto  assets  customers  pledge  as  collateral  against  certain  of  our  loans  to  them.  We  do  not  use  these
assets as a source of liquidity otherwise. Crypto assets held for investment are primarily long-term holdings and in certain cases fulfill capital
requirements set by regulators (see also Capital requirements below). We do not plan to engage in regular trading of these crypto assets but
may  purchase  additional  crypto  assets  for  investment  as  a  buy  and  hold  strategy.  In  case  of  a  liquidity  stress  event,  or  for  other  episodic
purposes,  which  may  necessitate  the  use  of  these  assets,  we  may  change  our  policy  and  sell  crypto  assets  held  for  investment  to  generate
liquidity. During times of instability in the crypto assets market, we may not be able to sell our crypto assets at reasonable prices or at all. Our
crypto assets held are considered less liquid than our cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to
the  same  extent  as  cash  and  cash  equivalents. As  of  March  31,  2025,  we  held  the  following  crypto  assets:  $67.5  million  held  for  operations,
$597.5 million held as collateral, $235.4 million that were borrowed, and $1.3 billion held for investment.

Customer assets and liabilities

Recognized  customer  assets  and  liabilities  comprise  customer  custodial  funds  and  corresponding  customer  custodial  liabilities  that
represent our obligation to return these assets to the customers. We also securely store additional customer AOP that we do not recognize in our
Condensed Consolidated

38

Table of Contents

Balance Sheets. We do not use customer crypto assets as collateral for any loan, margin, rehypothecation, or other similar activities to which we
or our affiliates are a party, without the customer’s consent.

Our business model does not expose us to liquidity risk if we have excessive redemptions or withdrawals from customers. As of March 31,
2025, we have not experienced excessive redemptions or withdrawals, or prolonged suspended redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets to
date.

Capital requirements

Although  currently  we  are  not  supervised  by  any  federal  banking  agency,  and  our  trading  platform  is  not  an  SEC-regulated  national
securities exchange or alternative trading system, we operate globally in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment and are subject
to  a  wide  range  of  laws  and  regulations  enacted  by  U.S.  federal,  state,  and  local  and  foreign  governments  and  regulatory  authorities. These
rules and regulations govern how we manage our liquidity, operations, and capital structure. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries hold licenses
to operate as trust companies, money transmitters, and derivatives exchanges, or equivalents, requiring compliance with strict safeguards for
customer  funds  and  crypto  assets,  as  well  as  capital  and  net  worth  requirements.  For  more  information,  see  Part  I,  Item  1.  “Business–
Government Regulations” in the Annual Report as well as Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In certain jurisdictions, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law, at
a  level  equal  to  at  least  100%  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  all  customer  custodial  fund  liabilities.  Eligible  liquid  assets  can  include  cash,  cash
equivalents, customer custodial funds, and in-transit customer receivables. As of March 31, 2025 our eligible liquid assets were greater than the
aggregate amount of customer custodial fund liabilities.

Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of USDC and crypto
asset transactions, as well as USDC and crypto assets under custody. As of March 31, 2025, in aggregate, these subsidiaries were compliant
with associated capital requirements of approximately $1.6 billion, which were met by a combination of corporate cash and cash equivalents and
certain crypto assets held.

Our  largest  source  of  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  are  revenues  generated  from  transaction  fees.  Our  primary  uses  of  cash  in

39

Table of Contents

Net cash used in operating activities increased by $594.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily

due to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

a $735.9 million increase in cash used to purchase USDC, reflecting higher customer demand;

a $31.5 million increase in cash used to pay income taxes;

a $27.8 million increase in cash used in policy spend as we increased our crypto advocacy efforts; and

an overall increase in other cash expenses as we continue to grow our business; offset in part by

an increase in cash provided as a result of the $396.7 million increase in total revenue; and

a $36.0 million decrease in cash used as a result of higher annual employee performance compensation payouts during the prior year.

Investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $106.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024 as we

invested more of our available cash, including:

•

•

•

an increase of $189.0 million in cash used for purchases of crypto assets held for investment; and

an increase of $19.7 million in cash used for purchases of strategic investments; offset in part by

a decrease of $131.9 million in cash used for the origination of fiat loans, net of repayments, reflecting a decline in demand for Prime
Financing products.

Financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities increased by $2.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily due

to:

•

•

•

a  $1.5  billion  decrease  in  customer  custodial  cash,  as  we  saw  an  increase  in  average  customer  USDC  balances  held  in  Coinbase
products, which offer a higher yield;

a $1.1 billion net decrease in cash provided as the prior year included proceeds from the issuance of our 2030 Convertible Notes less
cash paid for associated capped calls; and

a $200.8 million net decrease in recognized fiat collateral pledged by institutional customers related to Prime Financing loans reflecting
changes in demand.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  the  related  notes  included  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  are
prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements also requires us to make estimates
and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  costs,  and  expenses  and  related  disclosures.  We  base  our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial
statement presentation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows will be affected.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in the

Annual Report.

Recent accounting pronouncements

date of this report.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements associated with the effect of changes in market factors, including
risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency, derivatives, equity investments, and crypto assets. These assets, liabilities, and equities are
held for purposes other than trading. There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures from the information presented in Part
II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2024 except for our market risk exposure on our crypto assets held for investment. Though the nature of this exposure and the overall implied
volatility of the crypto assets underlying this exposure have not changed since December 31, 2024, the number of units we hold and the price of
the assets have changed, resulting in a material change in the result of our sensitivity analysis.

Crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term, and historically, we have not attempted to reduce our market risk exposure
associated with these crypto assets. Crypto asset prices have been volatile, as demonstrated by the one year historical volatility of Bitcoin and
Ethereum  of  approximately  50%  implied  from  the  annualized  standard  deviation  of  daily  price  returns  observed  in  the  past  24  months.  A
hypothetical 50% increase or decrease in crypto assets prices as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 would result in a $634.0 million and
$776.5 million impact, respectively, to the value of our Crypto assets held for investment and would have been recorded as a gain or loss in our
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease in the hypothetical gain or loss since December 31, 2024 primarily reflects
decreases in the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, offset in part by an increase in the units of each that we hold, as we increased our investment
in crypto assets during the quarter, deploying available cash.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our  management,  with  the  participation  and  supervision  of  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  (our  principal  executive  officer)  and  our  Chief
Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange Act)  as  of  March  31,  2025.  Based  on  such  evaluation,  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that as of March 31, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at a

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The  effectiveness  of  any  system  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  including  ours,  is  subject  to  inherent  limitations,  including  the
exercise  of  judgment  in  designing,  implementing,  operating,  and  evaluating  the  controls  and  procedures,  and  the  inability  to  eliminate
misconduct  completely.  Accordingly,  in  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  management  recognizes  that  any
system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not
absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact
that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that  management  is  required  to  apply  its  judgment  in  evaluating  the  benefits  of  possible  controls  and
procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We
intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such
improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

For a description of material legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

We are not presently a party to any other legal or regulatory proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to
us,  would  individually  or  taken  together  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results,  financial  condition,  or  cash  flows.
However, we are subject to regulatory oversight by numerous state, federal, and foreign regulators and we are and we may become subject to
various legal proceedings, inquiries, investigations, and demand letters that arise in the course of our business. For example, we have received
investigative subpoenas and other inquiries from various state agencies and attorneys general for documents and information pertaining to our
business  practices  and  policies,  customer  complaints,  asset  launches,  certain  ongoing  litigation,  and  certain  transfers  of  crypto  assets.  In
addition,  we  have  received  investigative  subpoenas  from  the  SEC  and  similar  subpoenas  and  demand  letters  from  various  regulators  for
documents  and  information,  including  about  certain  customer  programs,  operations,  and  existing  and  intended  future  products,  including  our
processes for listing assets, the classification of certain listed assets, our staking programs, and our stablecoin and yield-generating products.
We intend to cooperate fully with such investigations. These examples are not exhaustive.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The risks
and  uncertainties  described  below  are  not  the  only  ones  we  face. Additional  risks  and  uncertainties  that  we  are  unaware  of  or  that  we  deem
immaterial  may  also  become  important  factors  that  adversely  affect  our  business.  If  any  of  the  following  risks  occur,  our  business,  operating
results, financial condition, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Many risks affect more than one category, and the
risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. The market price of our Class A
common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment due to any of these risks.

The Most Material Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position

Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto.

Due  to  the  highly  volatile  nature  of  the  cryptoeconomy  and  the  prices  of  crypto  assets,  our  operating  results  have,  and  will  continue  to,
fluctuate  significantly  from  quarter  to  quarter  in  accordance  with  market  sentiments  and  movements  in  the  broader  cryptoeconomy.  Our
operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are unpredictable and in certain instances
are outside of our control, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for crypto assets, which can be highly volatile;

our ability to attract, maintain, grow, and engage our customer and developer base;

changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, or actions by U.S. or foreign governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or
consent decrees;

regulatory changes or scrutiny that impact our ability to offer certain products or services;

our ability to continue to diversify and grow our subscription and services revenue;

our mix of revenue between transaction and subscription and services;

pricing for or temporary suspensions of our products and services;

adding crypto assets to, or removing from, our platform;

our ability to establish and maintain partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties;

• market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, the cryptoeconomy;

• macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, changes in tariffs and trade restrictions, and instability in the global banking

system;

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

adverse  legal  proceedings  or  regulatory  enforcement  actions,  judgments,  settlements,  or  other  legal  proceedings,  and  enforcement-
related costs;

the development and introduction of existing and new products and services by us or our competitors;

the amount and timing of our operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations, including
investments  we  make  in  the  development  of  products  and  services,  as  well  as  technology  offered  to  our  developers,  international
expansion, and sales and marketing;

system failures, outages or interruptions, including with respect to our platform and third-party crypto networks;

our  lack  of  control  over  decentralized  or  third-party  blockchains  and  networks  that  may  experience  downtime,  cyberattacks,  critical
failures, errors, bugs, corrupted files, data losses, or other similar software failures, outages, breaches and losses;

breaches of security or privacy;

inaccessibility of our platform due to our or third-party actions;

our ability to attract and retain talent; and

our ability to compete with our competitors.

43

Table of Contents

As  a  result  of  these  factors,  it  is  difficult  for  us  to  forecast  growth  trends  accurately  and  our  business  and  future  prospects  are  difficult  to
evaluate,  particularly  in  the  short  term.  In  particular,  our  subscription  and  services  revenue  has  grown  over  time,  with  stablecoin  revenue
received in connection with USDC becoming a more meaningful revenue contributor. Therefore, our operating results could fluctuate significantly
as a result of changes in the demand for our subscription and service offerings, in the demand for USDC, in the mix of USDC balances held in
Coinbase products as compared to that held off-platform, in interest rates, and to our ongoing relationships with third parties, such as Circle.

In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the cryptoeconomy, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not
be  meaningful,  and  you  should  not  rely  upon  them  as  an  indication  of  future  performance.  Quarterly  and  annual  expenses  reflected  in  our
financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall
below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock may increase or decrease
significantly.

Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform. If
such price or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected and the price of
our Class A common stock could decline.

We generate a large portion of our total revenue from transaction fees on our platform in connection with the purchase, sale, and trading of
crypto assets by our customers. Transaction revenue is based on transaction fees that are either a flat fee or a percentage of the value of each
transaction. For our consumer trading product, we also charge a spread to ensure that we are able to settle purchases and sales at the prices
we quote to customers. We also generate a large portion of total revenue from our subscription and services, and such revenue has grown over
time, primarily due to growth in stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC. Declines in the volume of crypto asset transactions, the price of
crypto assets, or market liquidity for crypto assets generally may result in lower total revenue to us.

The price of crypto assets and associated demand for buying, selling, and trading crypto assets have historically been subject to significant
volatility.  If  the  price  and  transaction  volume  of  crypto  assets  decline  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  generate  revenue  may  suffer  and  customer
demand  for  our  products  and  services  may  decline,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results  and  financial  condition  and
cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. The price and transaction volume of any crypto asset is subject to significant uncertainty
and volatility, depending on a number of factors, including:

• market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, crypto assets and the cryptoeconomy, including, but not limited to, as a result of

actions taken by or developments of other companies in the cryptoeconomy;

changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities;

trading activities on other crypto platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative activities;

investment and trading activities of highly active consumer and institutional users, speculators, miners, and investors;

the speed and rate at which crypto is able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store of value, consumptive asset, security
instrument, or other financial assets worldwide, if at all;

decreased user and investor confidence in crypto assets and crypto platforms;

negative publicity and events relating to the cryptoeconomy;

unpredictable social media coverage or “trending” of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding, crypto assets;

national and international economic and political conditions.

There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the
event  that  the  price  of  crypto  assets  or  the  demand  for  trading  crypto  assets  decline,  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition
would be adversely affected and the price of our Class A common stock could decline.

Our net revenue may be concentrated in a limited number of areas. Within transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue,
a meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC,
respectively. If revenue from

45

Table of Contents

these areas declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets or other products and services, our business, operating
results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

While we support a diverse portfolio of crypto assets for trading, staking and custody, our net revenue is concentrated in a limited number of
areas, such as transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum for transaction revenue and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC for subscription
and services revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024, we derived a meaningful amount of
our net revenue from transaction fees generated in connection with the trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum; these trading pairs drove approximately
38%  and  44%  of  total  Trading  Volume  on  our  platform  during  these  periods,  respectively.  In  addition  to  the  factors  impacting  the  broader
cryptoeconomy described in this section, our revenue may be adversely affected if the markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum deteriorate or if their
prices decline, including as a result of the following factors:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the reduction in blockchain transaction fees of Bitcoin, including block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific
period of time and reduce the block reward earned by miners;

public  sentiment  related  to  the  actual  or  perceived  environmental  impact  of  Bitcoin,  Ethereum,  and  related  activities,  including
environmental concerns raised by private individuals and governmental actors related to the energy resources consumed in the Bitcoin
mining process;

disruptions, hacks, splits in the underlying networks also known as “forks,” attacks by malicious actors who control a significant portion of
the  networks’  hash  rate  such  as  double  spend  or  51%  attacks,  or  other  similar  incidents  affecting  the  Bitcoin  or  Ethereum  blockchain
networks;

hard “forks” resulting in the creation of and divergence into multiple separate networks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic;

informal governance led by Bitcoin and Ethereum’s core developers that lead to revisions to the underlying source code or inactions that
prevent network scaling, and which evolve over time largely based on self-determined participation, which may result in new changes or
updates that affect their speed, security, usability, or value;

the ability for Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain networks to resolve significant scaling challenges and increase the volume and speed of
transactions;

the ability to attract and retain customers and developers to use Bitcoin and Ethereum for payment, store of value, unit of accounting,
and  other  intended  uses  and  the  absence  of  another  supported  crypto  asset  to  attract  and  retain  developers  and  customers  for  the
same;

transaction  congestion  and  fees  associated  with  processing  transactions  on  the  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  networks  and  the  absence  of
another supported crypto asset to replace these transactions;

the  identification  of  Satoshi  Nakamoto,  the  pseudonymous  person  or  persons  who  developed  Bitcoin,  or  the  transfer  of  Satoshi’s
Bitcoins;

negative perception of Bitcoin or Ethereum;

developments  in  mathematics  and  technology,  including  in  digital  computing,  algebraic  geometry,  and  quantum  computing  that  could
result in the cryptography being used by Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming insecure or ineffective;

adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, or settlements impacting cryptoeconomy participants;

regulatory,  legislative  or  other  compulsory  or  informal  restrictions  or  limitations  on  Bitcoin  or  Ethereum  lending,  mining  or  staking
activities;

liquidity and credit risk issues experienced by other crypto platforms and other participants of the cryptoeconomy; and

46

Table of Contents

•

laws  and  regulations  affecting  the  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  networks  or  access  to  these  networks,  including  a  determination  that  either
Bitcoin or Ethereum constitutes a controlled or otherwise regulated financial instrument under the laws of any jurisdiction.

Our subscription and services revenue has grown over time to represent a more meaningful amount of our revenue, primarily due to growth
in stablecoin revenue received in connection with USDC. Such revenue depends on a variety of factors, including demand for our subscription
and  services  offerings,  demand  for  USDC,  the  overall  USDC  market  capitalization,  the  mix  of  USDC  balances  held  in  Coinbase  products  as
compared to that held off-platform, interest rates, and our ongoing relationships with third parties, such as Circle. If such factors are negatively
impacted, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third
parties. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining strategic relationships with these third parties or if these third parties fail
to deliver certain operational services, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties in
connection  with  the  development,  operation,  and  enhancement  of  our  platform  and  products  and  the  provision  of  our  services.  For  example,
Circle provides us with creation and redemption services for USDC, including the operational capabilities required for our USDC customer-facing
services. If Circle fails to provide certain operational services, our ability to maintain our current level of offerings and customer experience for
USDC  could  be  harmed  and  interest  or  confidence  in  USDC  could  be  impacted.  Identifying  strategic  relationships  with  third  parties  and
negotiating and documenting relationships with them may be time-consuming and complex and may distract management. Moreover, we may be
delayed,  or  not  be  successful,  in  achieving  the  objectives  that  we  anticipate  as  a  result  of  such  strategic  relationships.  In  evaluating
counterparties in connection with partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures or strategic alliances, we consider a wide range of economic, legal
and  regulatory  criteria  depending  on  the  nature  of  such  relationship,  including  the  counterparties’  reputation,  operating  results  and  financial
condition, operational ability to satisfy our and our customers’ needs in a timely manner, efficiency and reliability of systems, certifications costs
to us or to our customers, and licensure and compliance status. Despite this evaluation, third parties may still not meet our or our customers’
needs which may adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers, and could adversely affect our business, operating
results, and financial condition. Counterparties to any strategic relationship may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that
may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may subject us to additional risks to the extent any such third party becomes
the subject of negative publicity, faces its own litigation or regulatory challenges, or faces other adverse circumstances. Conflicts may arise with
our  strategic  partners,  such  as  the  interpretation  of  significant  terms  under  any  agreement,  which  may  result  in  litigation  or  arbitration  which
would  increase  our  expenses  and  divert  the  attention  of  our  management.  If  we  are  unsuccessful  in  establishing  or  maintaining  strategic
relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our business, operating
results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Interest rate fluctuations could negatively impact us.

The level of prevailing short-term interest rates affects our profitability because we derive a large portion of our revenue from interest earned
on  funds  deposited  with  us  by  our  customers  which  we  hold  on  their  behalf  in  custodial  accounts  at  financial  institutions  and  from  stablecoin
revenue,  which  is  derived  from  interest  earned  on  USDC  reserve  balances,  as  well  as  from  interest  earned  on  corporate  cash  and  cash
equivalents. Higher interest rates increase the amount of interest and finance fee income and stablecoin revenue earned from these activities.
When short-term interest rates decline, our revenue derived from interest correspondingly declines. Further, because stablecoin revenue from
USDC has become an increased portion of our subscription and services revenue, if interest rates were to

47

Table of Contents

significantly decline from levels reached in the current interest rate environment, our net revenue could decline. Conversely, when interest rates
increase,  investors  may  choose  to  shift  their  asset  allocations,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  stock  price  or  the  cryptoeconomy  more
generally.

The future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If crypto does
not grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Crypto  assets  built  on  blockchain  technology  were  only  introduced  in  2008  and  remain  in  the  early  stages  of  development.  In  addition,
different crypto assets are designed for different purposes. Bitcoin, for instance, was designed to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,
while  Ethereum  was  designed  to  be  a  smart  contract  and  decentralized  application  platform.  Many  other  crypto  networks,  ranging  from  cloud
computing to tokenized securities networks, have only recently been established. The further growth and development of any crypto assets and
their  underlying  networks  and  other  cryptographic  and  algorithmic  protocols  governing  the  creation,  transfer,  and  usage  of  crypto  assets
represent a new and evolving paradigm that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, including:

• many crypto networks have limited operating histories, have not been validated in production, and are still in the process of developing
and  making  significant  decisions  that  will  affect  the  design,  supply,  issuance,  functionality,  and  governance  of  their  respective  crypto
assets and underlying blockchain networks, any of which could adversely affect their respective crypto assets;

• many crypto networks are in the process of implementing software upgrades and other changes to their protocols, which could introduce

bugs, security risks, or adversely affect the respective crypto networks;

•

•

•

•

•

•

several  large  networks,  including  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum,  are  developing  new  features  to  address  fundamental  speed,  scalability,  and
energy usage issues. If these issues are not successfully addressed, or if these networks do not achieve widespread adoption, it could
adversely affect the underlying crypto assets;

security issues, bugs, and software errors have been identified with many crypto assets and their underlying blockchain networks, some
of which have been exploited by malicious actors. There are also inherent security weaknesses in some crypto assets, such as when
creators  of  certain  crypto  networks  use  procedures  that  could  allow  hackers  to  counterfeit  tokens. Any  weaknesses  identified  with  a
crypto asset could adversely affect its price, security, liquidity, and adoption rate. If one or more malicious actors obtains a majority of the
compute or staking power on a crypto network, as has happened in the past, it may be able to engage in illicit activity, which could cause
financial losses to holders, damage the network’s reputation and security, and adversely affect its value;

the  development  of  new  technologies  for  mining,  such  as  improved  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (commonly  referred  to  as
ASICs),  or  changes  in  industry  patterns,  such  as  the  consolidation  of  mining  power  in  a  small  number  of  large  mining  farms,  could
reduce  the  security  of  blockchain  networks,  lead  to  increased  liquid  supply  of  crypto  assets,  and  reduce  a  crypto  asset’s  price  and
attractiveness;

if  rewards  and  transaction  fees  for  miners  or  validators  on  any  particular  crypto  network  are  not  sufficiently  high  to  attract  and  retain
miners or validators, a crypto network’s security and speed may be adversely affected, increasing the likelihood of a malicious attack;

crypto networks may have consolidated points of failure (such as concentrated ownership or an “admin key”), allowing a small group of
holders  to  have  significant  unilateral  control  and  influence  over  key  decisions  related  to  their  crypto  networks,  such  as  governance
decisions and protocol changes, as well as the market price of such crypto assets;

the  governance  of  many  decentralized  blockchain  networks,  including  L2  blockchains  like  Base,  is  by  voluntary  consensus  and  open
competition, and many developers are not directly

48

Table of Contents

compensated for their contributions. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of any particular crypto
network, a lack of incentives for developers to maintain or develop the network, and other unforeseen issues, any of which could result
in unexpected or undesirable errors, bugs, or changes, or stymie such network’s utility and ability to respond to challenges and grow;
and

• many crypto networks are in the early stages of developing partnerships and collaborations, any or all of which may not succeed and

adversely affect the usability and adoption of the respective crypto assets.

Various other technical issues have also been uncovered from time to time that resulted in disabled functionalities, exposure of certain users’
personal  information,  theft  of  users’  assets,  and  other  negative  consequences,  and  which  required  resolution  with  the  attention  and  efforts  of
their global miner, user, and development communities. If any such risks or other risks materialize, and in particular if they are not resolved, the
development and growth of crypto may be significantly affected and, as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Cyberattacks and security breaches of our platform, or those impacting our customers or third parties, could adversely affect our
brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our  business  involves  the  collection,  storage,  processing,  and  transmission  of  confidential  information,  customer,  employee,  service
provider, and other personal data, as well as information required to access customer assets. We have built our reputation on the premise that
our platform offers customers a secure way to purchase, store, and transact in crypto assets. As a result, any actual or perceived security breach
of us or our third-party partners may:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

harm our reputation and brand;

result in our systems or services being unavailable and interrupt our operations;

result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and data protection laws;

result in significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties, and other legal, regulatory, and financial exposure;

cause us to incur significant remediation costs;

lead to theft or irretrievable loss of our or our customers’ fiat currencies or crypto assets;

reduce customer confidence in, or decrease customer use of, our products and services;

divert the attention of management from the operation of our business;

result in significant compensation or contractual penalties payable by us to our customers or third parties as a result of losses to them or
claims by them; and

adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

For example, in 2021, third parties independently obtained login credentials and personal information for at least 6,000 customers and used
those  credentials  to  exploit  a  vulnerability  that  previously  existed  in  the  account  recovery  process.  We  reimbursed  impacted  customers
approximately $25.1 million.

Further, any actual or perceived breach or cybersecurity attack directed at other financial institutions or crypto companies, whether or not we
are directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in the cryptoeconomy or in the use of technology to conduct financial
transactions,  which  could  negatively  impact  us,  including  the  market  perception  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  security  measures  and  technology
infrastructure.

49

Table of Contents

An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial institutions, as well as
government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly
targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.

Attacks  upon  systems  across  a  variety  of  industries,  including  the  crypto  industry,  are  increasing  in  their  frequency,  persistence,  and
sophistication,  and,  in  many  cases,  are  being  conducted  by  sophisticated,  well-funded,  and  organized  groups  and  individuals,  including  state
actors. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data
and crypto assets), disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not
recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. These attacks may occur on our systems or those of our third-party
service providers or partners. Certain types of cyberattacks could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed. For example, attacks may be
designed  to  deceive  employees  and  service  providers  into  releasing  control  of  our  systems  to  a  hacker,  while  others  may  aim  to  introduce
computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to stealing confidential or proprietary data. Additionally, certain threats are designed to
remain dormant or undetectable until launched against a target, and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures.

Although  we  have  developed  systems  and  processes  designed  to  protect  the  data  we  manage,  prevent  data  loss  and  other  security
breaches, effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections,
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  security  measures  will  provide  absolute  security  or  prevent  breaches  or  attacks.  We  have  experienced
from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system
errors  or  vulnerabilities,  or  other  irregularities.  Unauthorized  parties  have  attempted,  and  we  expect  that  they  will  continue  to  attempt,  to  gain
access  to  our  systems  and  facilities,  as  well  as  those  of  our  customers,  partners,  and  third-party  service  providers,  through  various  means,
including  hacking,  social  engineering,  phishing,  and  attempting  to  fraudulently  induce  individuals  (including  employees,  service  providers,  and
our customers) into disclosing usernames, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to
access  our  information  technology  systems  and  customers’  crypto  assets.  Threats  can  come  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  criminal
hackers,  hacktivists,  state-sponsored  intrusions,  industrial  espionage,  and  insiders.  Certain  threat  actors  may  be  supported  by  significant
financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We may also acquire other companies that
expose us to unexpected security risks or increase costs to improve the security posture of the acquired company. Further, there has been an
increase in such threat actor activities as a result of the increased prevalence of hybrid and remote working arrangements in recent years. As a
result, our costs and the resources we devote to protecting against these advanced threats and their consequences may continue to increase
over time.

Although we maintain insurance coverage, it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from security breaches,
cyberattacks, and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions or data theft and loss from such events. Outages and disruptions of
our platform, including any caused by cyberattacks, may harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to
comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Our business is subject to extensive laws, rules, regulations, policies, orders, determinations, directives, treaties, and legal and regulatory
interpretations and guidance in the markets in which we operate, including those governing financial services and banking, federal government
contractors,  trust  companies,  securities,  derivative  transactions  and  markets,  broker-dealers  and  alternative  trading  systems  (“ATS”),
commodities, credit, crypto asset custody, exchange, and transfer, cross-border and

domestic  money  and  crypto  asset  transmission,  commercial  lending,  usury,  foreign  currency  exchange,  privacy,  data  governance,  data
protection,  cybersecurity,  fraud  detection,  payment  services  (including  payment  processing  and  settlement  services),  consumer  protection,
escheatment, antitrust and competition, bankruptcy, tax, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist
financing.  Many  of  these  legal  and  regulatory  regimes  were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  internet,  mobile  technologies,  crypto  assets,
generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) and related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address
unique issues associated with the cryptoeconomy, are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across U.S. federal, state, and local and
international jurisdictions. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may
be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. Moreover, the
complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the cryptoeconomy requires us to
exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators
may disagree with our conclusions. To the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant
fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on or temporary or permanent suspensions of our products and services, reputational harm, and other
regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Additionally,  various  governmental  and  regulatory  bodies,  including  legislative  and  executive  bodies,  in  the  United  States  and  in  other
countries may adopt new laws and regulations, the direction and timing of which may be influenced by changes in the governing administrations
and  major  events  in  the  cryptoeconomy.  For  example,  following  the  failure  of  several  prominent  crypto  trading  venues  and  lending  platforms,
such as FTX, Celsius Networks, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital in 2022 (the “2022 Events”), the U.S. Congress expressed the need for both
greater federal oversight of the cryptoeconomy and comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation.

Governmental  and  regulatory  bodies,  including  in  the  United  States,  may  introduce  new  policies,  laws,  and  regulations  relating  to  crypto
assets  and  the  cryptoeconomy  generally,  and  crypto  asset  platforms  in  particular.  Other  companies’  failures  of  risk  management  and  other
control functions, including those that played a role in the 2022 Events, could contribute to stricter oversight of crypto asset platforms and the
cryptoeconomy.  Furthermore,  new  interpretations  of  existing  laws  and  regulations  may  be  issued  by  such  bodies  or  the  judiciary,  which  may
adversely  impact  the  development  of  the  cryptoeconomy  as  a  whole  and  our  legal  and  regulatory  status  in  particular  by  changing  how  we
operate our business, how our products and services are regulated, and what products or services we and our competitors can offer, requiring
changes to our compliance and risk mitigation measures, imposing new licensing requirements, or imposing a total ban on certain crypto asset
transactions,  as  has  occurred  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  the  past.  For  example,  in  April  2023,  the  SEC  reopened  a  comment  period  for
amendments  to  Rule  3b-16  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”),  that  could  subject  several
cryptoeconomy  participants  and  systems  to  registration  or  other  operational  compliance  requirements  under  the  Exchange Act.  If  the  SEC’s
proposed  amendment  is  adopted  in  its  current  form,  we,  along  with  other  cryptoeconomy  participants,  could  face  significant  additional
uncertainty  and  risk  of  increased  operational  costs.  In  November  2023,  the  New  York  Department  of  Financial  Services  (“NYDFS”)  adopted
guidance regarding the policies and procedures required for virtual currency business entities licensed in New York, such as Coinbase, Inc. This
guidance and other applicable state law guidance regarding virtual currency business activity could result in changes to our business in such
states  as  well  as  the  risk  of  increased  operational  costs  and  the  risk  of  enforcement  actions.  If  we  are  unable  to  comply  with  any  new
requirements, our ability to offer our products and services in their current form may be adversely affected. Additionally, under recommendations
from  the  Financial  Crimes  Enforcement  Network  (“FinCEN”),  and  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force,  the  United  States  and  several  foreign
jurisdictions have or are likely to impose the Funds Transfer Rule (commonly referred to as the Travel Rule) on financial service providers in the
cryptoeconomy. We may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with the Travel Rule and

51

Table of Contents

may  be  further  subject  to  administrative  sanctions  for  technical  violations  or  customer  attrition  if  the  user  experience  suffers  as  a  result.  In
October 2023, FinCEN released a proposed rule that identifies virtual currency “mixing” as a class of transactions of primary money laundering
concern and imposes heightened recordkeeping and reporting obligations for financial institutions with respect to those transactions. There are
substantial uncertainties regarding the scope of these requirements in practice, and we may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply
with these rules.

Moreover, we offer and may in the future offer products and services whose functionality or value depends in part on our management of
token  transaction  smart  contracts,  liquid  staking,  asset  tracking,  or  other  applications  that  provide  novel  forms  of  customer  engagement  and
interaction delivered via blockchain protocols. We may also offer products and services whose functionality or value depends on our ability to
develop,  integrate,  or  otherwise  interact  with  such  applications  within  the  bounds  of  our  legal  and  compliance  obligations.  The  legal  and
regulatory landscape for such products, including the law governing the rights and obligations between and among smart contract developers
and  users  and  the  extent  to  which  such  relationships  entail  regulated  activity  is  uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving.  Our  interaction  with  those
applications, and the interaction of other blockchain users with any smart contracts or assets we may generate or control, could present legal,
operational, reputational, and regulatory risks for our business.

We may be further subject to administrative sanctions for technical violations or customer attrition if the user experience suffers as a result.
As  another  example,  the  extension  of  anti-money  laundering  requirements  to  certain  crypto-related  activities  by  the  European  Union’s  Fifth
Money Laundering Directive, as updated by the European Union’s Sixth Money Laundering Directive, has increased the regulatory compliance
burden for our business in Europe and, as a result of the fragmented approach to the implementation of its provisions, resulted in distinct and
divergent  national  licensing  and  registration  regimes  for  us  in  different  E.U.  member  states.  Further  E.U.-level  legislation  imposing  additional
regulatory requirements in relation to crypto-related activities is also expected in the near term, such as with the effectiveness of the Markets in
Crypto-Assets Regulation (“MiCA”). Among other provisions, MiCA introduces a comprehensive authorization and compliance regime for crypto
asset service providers and a disclosure regime for the issuers of certain crypto assets, which will impact our operations in the European Union,
including through localization requirements.

Because we have offered and will continue to offer a variety of innovative products and services to our customers, many of our offerings are
subject to significant regulatory uncertainty and we from time to time face regulatory inquiries regarding our current and planned products. For
instance,  we  purchase  USDC,  a  stablecoin  redeemable  on  a  one-to-one  basis  for  U.S.  dollars,  from  Circle  and  sell  it  to  customers  on  our
platform.  The  regulatory  treatment  of  fiat-backed  stablecoins  is  highly  uncertain  and  has  drawn  significant  attention  from  legislative  and
regulatory bodies around the world. The issuance, purchase, and sale of such stablecoins may implicate a variety of banking, deposit, money
transmission, prepaid access and stored value, anti-money laundering, commodities, securities, sanctions, and other laws and regulations in the
United States and in other jurisdictions. There are substantial uncertainties as to how these requirements would apply in practice, and we may
face substantial compliance costs to operationalize and comply with these rules. Certain products and services offered by us that we believe are
not subject to regulatory oversight, or are only subject to certain regulatory regimes, such as Coinbase Wallet, a standalone mobile application
that  allows  customers  to  manage  their  own  private  keys  and  store  their  crypto  assets  directly  on  their  mobile  devices,  may  cause  us  to  be
deemed to be engaged in a form of regulated activity for which licensure is required or cause us to become subject to new and additional forms
of regulatory oversight. We also offer various staking, rewards, and lending products, all of which are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty,
and could implicate a variety of laws and regulations worldwide. For example, there is regulatory uncertainty regarding the status of our staking,
lending, rewards, and other yield-generating activities under the U.S. federal and state securities laws. While we have implemented policies and
procedures, including geofencing for certain products and services, designed to help monitor for and ensure compliance with existing and new
laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we and our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate or

52

Table of Contents

otherwise fail to comply with such laws and regulations. To the extent that we or our employees, contractors, or agents are deemed or alleged to
have violated or failed to comply with any laws or regulations, including related interpretations, orders, determinations, directives, or guidance,
we  or  they  could  be  subject  to  a  litany  of  civil,  criminal,  and  administrative  fines,  penalties,  orders  and  actions,  including  being  required  to
suspend  or  terminate  the  offering  of  certain  products  and  services.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  our  customers  nevertheless  access  our  platform,
products  or  services  outside  of  jurisdictions  where  we  have  obtained  required  governmental  licenses  and  authorization,  we  could  similarly  be
subject to a variety of civil, criminal, and administrative fines, penalties, orders and actions as a result of such activity.

Due to our business activities, we are subject to ongoing examinations, oversight, and reviews and currently are, and expect in the future, to
be subject to investigations and inquiries, by U.S. federal and state regulators and foreign financial service regulators, many of which have broad
discretion to audit and examine our business. We are periodically subject to audits and examinations by these regulatory authorities. As a result
of  findings  from  these  audits  and  examinations,  regulators  have,  are,  and  may  in  the  future  require  us  to  take  certain  actions,  including
amending,  updating,  or  revising  our  compliance  measures  from  time  to  time,  limiting  the  kinds  of  customers  that  we  provide  services  to,
changing, terminating, or delaying our licenses and the introduction of our existing or new product and services, and undertaking further external
audit  or  being  subject  to  further  regulatory  scrutiny,  including  investigations  and  inquiries.  We  have  received,  and  may  in  the  future  receive,
examination reports citing violations of rules and regulations, inadequacies in existing compliance programs, and requiring us to enhance certain
practices  with  respect  to  our  compliance  program,  including  due  diligence,  monitoring,  training,  reporting,  and  recordkeeping.  Implementing
appropriate  measures  to  properly  remediate  these  examination  findings  may  require  us  to  incur  significant  costs,  and  if  we  fail  to  properly
remediate any of these examination findings, we could face civil litigation, significant fines, damage awards, forced removal of certain employees
including  members  of  our  executive  team,  barring  of  certain  employees  from  participating  in  our  business  in  whole  or  in  part,  revocation  of
existing  licenses,  limitations  on  existing  and  new  products  and  services,  reputational  harm,  negative  impact  to  our  existing  relationships  with
regulators,  exposure  to  criminal  liability,  or  other  regulatory  consequences.  Further,  we  believe  increasingly  strict  legal  and  regulatory
requirements and additional regulatory investigations and enforcement, any of which could occur or intensify, may continue to result in changes
to our business, as well as increased costs, and supervision and examination for ourselves, our agents, and service providers. Moreover, new
laws,  regulations,  or  interpretations  may  result  in  additional  litigation,  regulatory  investigations,  and  enforcement  or  other  actions,  including
preventing or delaying us from offering certain products or services offered by our competitors or could impact how we offer such products and
services. Adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on
our reputation and brand and our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We operate in a highly competitive industry and we compete against unregulated or less regulated companies and companies with
greater financial and other resources, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if we
are unable to compete effectively.

The  crypto  industry  is  highly  innovative,  rapidly  evolving,  and  characterized  by  healthy  competition,  experimentation,  changing  customer
needs,  frequent  introductions  of  new  products  and  services,  and  subject  to  uncertain  and  evolving  industry  and  regulatory  requirements.  We
expect  competition  to  intensify  in  the  future  as  existing  and  new  competitors  introduce  new  products  or  enhance  existing  products.  We  face
significant competition from a variety of companies around the world, ranging from crypto-native companies, including decentralized exchanges,
to large traditional financial services incumbents and financial technology providers. Our main competition falls into the following categories:

•

traditional  financial  technology  and  brokerage  firms  that  have  entered  the  crypto  asset  market  in  recent  years  and  offer  overlapping
features targeted at our customers;

53

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

companies focused on the crypto asset market, some of whom adhere to local regulations and directly compete with our platform, and
others who choose to operate outside of local rules and regulations or in jurisdictions with less stringent local rules and regulations and
are potentially able to more quickly adapt to trends, support a greater number of crypto assets, and develop new crypto-based products
and services due to a different standard of regulatory scrutiny;

crypto-focused  companies  and  traditional  financial  incumbents  that  offer  point  or  siloed  solutions  specifically  targeted  at  institutional
customers;

decentralized and non-custodial platforms; and

stablecoins, other than USDC, and fiat currencies globally.

Historically, a major source of competition has been from companies, in particular those located outside the United States, who at times are
and may in the future be subject to significantly less stringent regulatory and compliance requirements in their local jurisdictions. Their business
models  rely  on  being  unregulated  or  only  regulated  in  a  small  number  of  lower  compliance  jurisdictions,  whilst  also  offering  their  products  in
highly  regulated  jurisdictions,  including  the  United  States,  without  necessarily  complying  with  the  relevant  regulatory  requirements  in  such
jurisdictions.

Given the uneven enforcement by United States and foreign regulators, many of these competitors have been able to operate from offshore
while  offering  large  numbers  of  products  and  services  to  consumers,  including  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  other  highly  regulated
jurisdictions, without complying with the relevant licensing and other requirements in these jurisdictions, and historically without penalty. Due to
our  regulated  status  in  several  jurisdictions  and  our  commitment  to  legal  and  regulatory  compliance,  we  have  not  been  able  to  offer  many
popular products and services, including products and services that our unregulated or less regulated competitors are able to offer.

We also have expended significant managerial, operational, and compliance costs to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in
the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate,  and  expect  to  continue  to  incur  significant  costs  to  comply  with  these  requirements,  which  these
unregulated or less regulated competitors have not had to incur.

Our competitors have made significant investments in research and development, and we expect these companies to continue to develop
similar  or  superior  products  and  technologies  that  compete  with  our  products.  Further,  more  traditional  financial  and  non-financial  services
businesses may choose to offer crypto-based services in the future as the industry gains adoption and barriers to entry lower. As regulations and
compliance requirements in the United States become clearer, we may face increased competition from companies based in the United States.
Our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance
their resources.

Our existing competitors have, and our potential competitors are expected to have, competitive advantages over us, such as:

•

•

•

the ability to trade crypto assets and offer products and services that we do not support or offer on our platform (due to constraints from
regulatory  authorities,  our  financial  institution  partners,  and  other  factors)  such  as  tokens  that  constitute  securities  or  derivative
instruments under U.S. or foreign laws;

greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and larger market shares;

larger sales and marketing budgets and organizations;

• more established marketing, banking, and compliance relationships;

•

greater customer support resources;

54

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

greater resources to make acquisitions;

lower labor, compliance, risk mitigation, and research and development costs;

larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios;

greater number of applicable licenses or similar authorizations;

established core business models outside of the trading of crypto assets, allowing them to operate on lesser margins or at a loss;

operations in certain jurisdictions with lower compliance costs and greater flexibility to explore new product offerings; and

substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.

If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our

competitors, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business, operating results, and financial
condition could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively.

We compete against an increasing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms. On these platforms, users can interact directly with
a market-making smart contract or onchain trading mechanism to earn crypto assets or to exchange one type of crypto asset for another without
any  centralized  intermediary.  We  have  seen  increased  interest  in  certain  decentralized  platforms  with  transaction  volumes  rivaling  our  own
platform on multiple occasions, and expect interest in decentralized and noncustodial platforms to grow further as the industry develops. If the
demand  for  decentralized  platforms  grows  and  we  are  unable  to  compete  with  these  decentralized  and  noncustodial  platforms,  including,  for
example, if we fail to achieve sufficient decentralization and scaling of Base as an L2, our business, operating results, and financial condition
could be adversely affected.

As we continue to expand and localize our international activities, our obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and
policies of a variety of jurisdictions will increase and we may be subject to inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions by U.S.
and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities, including those related to sanctions, export control, and anti-money
laundering.

As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws, rules, regulations,
policies, and legal interpretations of both the jurisdictions in which we operate and those into which we offer services on a cross-border basis.
For  instance,  financial  regulators  outside  the  United  States  have  increased  their  scrutiny  of  crypto  asset  exchanges  over  time,  such  as  by
requiring crypto asset exchanges operating in their local jurisdictions to be regulated and licensed under local laws. Moreover, laws regulating
financial services, the internet, mobile technologies, crypto, and related technologies outside of the United States are highly evolving, extensive
and often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. In addition, we are required to comply
with laws and regulations related to economic sanctions and export controls enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, and U.S. anti-money laundering and counter-
terrorist financing laws and regulations, enforced by FinCEN and certain state financial services regulators. U.S. sanctions and export control
laws  and  regulations  generally  restrict  dealings  by  persons  subject  to  U.S.  jurisdiction  with  certain  jurisdictions  that  are  the  target  of
comprehensive embargoes, currently the Crimea Region, the Donetsk People’s Republic, and the Luhansk People’s Republic of Ukraine, Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, and Syria, as well as with persons, entities, and governments identified on certain prohibited party lists. Moreover, as a result
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the E.U., the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions have imposed wide-

55

Table of Contents

ranging  sanctions  on  Russia  and  Belarus  and  persons  and  entities  associated  with  Russia  and  Belarus. There  can  be  no  certainty  regarding
whether  such  governments  or  other  governments  will  impose  additional  sanctions,  or  other  economic  or  military  measures  against  Russia  or
Belarus. We have continued to engage in activity in Russia and Belarus and with customers associated with these countries. At the same time,
we  have  implemented  additional  processes  and  procedures  to  comply  with  these  new  sanctions.  However,  our  activity  in  Russia  and  Belarus
and with these customers associated with these countries subjects us to further exposure to sanctions as they are released. We have an OFAC
compliance program in place that includes monitoring of IP addresses to identify prohibited jurisdictions and of blockchain addresses that have
either  been  identified  by  OFAC  as  prohibited  or  that  otherwise  are  believed  by  us  to  be  associated  with  prohibited  persons  or  jurisdictions.
Nonetheless, there can be no guarantee that our compliance program will prevent transactions with particular persons or addresses or prevent
every potential violation of OFAC sanctions. From time to time, we have submitted voluntary disclosures to OFAC or responded to administrative
subpoenas from OFAC. Certain of these voluntary self-disclosures are currently under review by OFAC. To date, none of those proceedings has
resulted in a monetary penalty or finding of violation. Any present or future government inquiries relating to sanctions could result in negative
consequences  for  us,  including  costs  related  to  government  investigations,  financial  penalties,  and  harm  to  our  reputation.  The  impact  on  us
related  to  such  matters  could  be  substantial. Although  we  have  implemented  controls,  and  are  working  to  implement  additional  controls  and
screening tools designed to prevent sanctions violations, there is no guarantee that we will not inadvertently provide access to our products and
services to sanctioned parties or jurisdictions in the future.

Regulators worldwide frequently study each other’s approaches to the regulation of the cryptoeconomy. Consequently, developments in any
jurisdiction  may  influence  other  jurisdictions.  New  developments  in  one  jurisdiction  may  be  extended  to  additional  services  and  other
jurisdictions. As  a  result,  the  risks  created  by  any  new  law  or  regulation  in  one  jurisdiction  are  magnified  by  the  potential  that  they  may  be
replicated,  affecting  our  business  in  another  place  or  involving  another  service.  Conversely,  if  regulations  diverge  worldwide,  we  may  face
difficulty  adjusting  our  products,  services,  and  other  aspects  of  our  business  with  the  same  effect.  These  risks  are  heightened  as  we  face
increased  competitive  pressure  from  other  similarly  situated  businesses  that  engage  in  regulatory  arbitrage  to  avoid  the  compliance  costs
associated with regulatory changes.

The  complexity  of  U.S.  federal  and  state  and  international  regulatory  and  enforcement  regimes,  coupled  with  the  global  scope  of  our
operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations
and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the
aggregate,  harm  our  reputation,  damage  our  brand,  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Due  to  the
uncertain application of existing laws and regulations, it may be that, despite our regulatory and legal analysis concluding that certain products
and  services  are  currently  unregulated,  such  products  or  services  may  indeed  be  subject  to  financial  regulation,  licensing,  or  authorization
obligations  that  we  have  not  obtained  or  with  which  we  have  not  complied. As  a  result,  we  are  at  a  heightened  risk  of  enforcement  action,
litigation,  regulatory,  and  legal  scrutiny  which  could  lead  to  sanctions,  cease  and  desist  orders,  or  other  penalties  and  censures  which  could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are, and may continue to be, subject to material litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits, as well as investigations
and enforcement actions by regulators and governmental authorities. These matters are often expensive and time consuming, and, if
resolved adversely, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We  have  been,  currently  are,  and  may  from  time  to  time  become  subject  to  claims,  arbitrations,  individual  and  class  action  lawsuits  with
respect to a variety of matters, including employment, consumer protection, advertising, and securities. In addition, we have been, currently are,
and may from time to time become subject to, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, other proceedings and
enforcement actions alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations, both foreign and

56

Table of Contents

domestic.  For  a  description  of  such  material  litigation,  regulatory  investigations,  and  other  proceedings,  see  Note  16.  Commitments  and
Contingencies of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-
Q.  The  scope,  determination,  and  impact  of  claims,  lawsuits,  government  and  regulatory  investigations,  enforcement  actions,  disputes,  and
proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty and may result in:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or penalties;

substantial outside counsel, advisor, and consultant fees and costs;

substantial administrative costs, including arbitration fees;

additional compliance and licensure requirements;

loss or non-renewal of existing licenses or authorizations, or prohibition from or delays in obtaining additional licenses or authorizations,
required for our business;

loss of productivity and high demands on employee time;

criminal sanctions or consent decrees;

termination of certain employees, including members of our executive team;

barring of certain employees from participating in our business in whole or in part;

orders that restrict our business or prevent us from offering certain products or services;

changes to our business model and practices;

delays to planned transactions, product launches or improvements; and

damage to our brand and reputation.

Because of our large customer base, actions against us may claim large monetary damages, even if the alleged per-customer harm is small
or  non-existent.  From  time  to  time,  we  receive  letters  alleging  claims  on  behalf  of  our  users.  Due  to  our  large  customer  base,  the  ongoing
defense and resolution or settlement of these alleged claims could be material and we may incur significant expenses associated with arbitrating
or litigating the claims. Moreover, to the extent that a deterioration of the crypto asset market occurs for a prolonged period, large platforms like
us may become subject to or the target of increased litigation and additional government and regulatory scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome,
any such matters could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition because of legal costs, diversion of management
resources, reputational damage, and other factors.

If we cannot keep pace with rapid industry changes to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and
services, and consequently our net revenue, could decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Our  industry  has  been  characterized  by  many  rapid,  significant,  and  disruptive  products  and  services  in  recent  years.  These  include
decentralized  applications,  DeFi,  yield  farming,  non-fungible  tokens  (“NFTs”),  play-to-earn  games,  lending,  staking  and  re-staking,  token
wrapping,  governance  tokens,  innovative  programs  to  attract  customers  such  as  transaction  fee  mining  programs,  initiatives  to  attract  traders
such as trading competitions, airdrops and giveaways, staking reward programs, “layer 2” blockchain networks, smart contract wallets, and novel
cryptocurrency fundraising and distribution schemes, such as “initial exchange offerings.” We expect new services and technologies to continue
to  emerge  and  evolve,  which  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  products  and  services  that  we  currently  provide.  For  example,
decentralized networks and other disruptive technologies such as generative AI may fundamentally alter the use of our products or services in
unpredictable ways. We cannot predict the effects of new services and technologies on our business. However, our ability to grow our customer
base and net revenue will depend heavily on our ability to innovate and create successful new products and services, both independently and in
conjunction with third-party developers. In particular, developing and incorporating new products and services into our business may require

57

Table of Contents

substantial  expenditures,  take  considerable  time,  and  ultimately  may  not  be  successful.  Any  new  products  or  services  could  fail  to  attract
customers,  generate  revenue,  or  perform  or  integrate  well  with  third-party  applications  and  platforms.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  adapt  and
compete  with  new  products  and  services  may  be  inhibited  by  regulatory  requirements  and  general  uncertainty  in  the  law,  constraints  by  our
financial  institution  partners  and  payment  processors,  third-party  intellectual  property  rights,  or  other  factors.  Moreover,  we  must  continue  to
enhance  our  technical  infrastructure  and  other  technology  offerings  to  remain  competitive  and  maintain  a  platform  that  has  the  required
functionality, performance, capacity, security, and speed to attract and retain customers, including large, institutional, high-frequency and high-
volume traders. As a result, we expect to incur significant costs and expenses to develop and upgrade our technical infrastructure to meet the
evolving needs of the industry. Our success will depend on our ability to develop, scale, and incorporate new offerings and adapt to technological
changes and evolving industry practices. If we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our ability to successfully compete, to
retain existing customers, and to attract new customers may be impacted and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

A particular crypto asset, product or service’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of
uncertainty and if we are unable to properly characterize a crypto asset or product offering, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny,
inquiries, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

The SEC and its staff have taken evolving positions as to whether a range of crypto assets, products and services fall within the definition of
a  “security”  under  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws.  Despite  the  SEC  being  the  principal  federal  securities  law  regulator  in  the  United  States,
whether or not an asset, product, or service is a security or constitutes a securities offering under federal securities laws is ultimately determined
by a federal court. The legal test for determining whether any given crypto asset, product, or service is an investment contract security was set
forth in the 1946 Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. and whether any given crypto asset, product, or service is a note in the 1990
Supreme Court case Reves v. Ernst & Young. The legal tests for determining whether any given crypto asset, product, or service is a security
requires a highly complex, fact-driven analysis. Accordingly, whether any given crypto asset, product or service would be ultimately deemed by a
federal court to be a security is uncertain and difficult to predict notwithstanding the conclusions of the SEC or any conclusions we may draw
based on our risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular crypto asset, product or service could be deemed a “security” or
“securities  offering”  under  applicable  laws.  The  SEC  generally  does  not  provide  advance  guidance  or  confirmation  on  its  assessment  of  the
status  of  any  particular  crypto  asset,  product,  or  service  as  a  security.  Furthermore,  in  our  view,  statements  by  the  SEC  and  its  staff  have
appeared  contradictory  at  times.  It  is  also  possible  that  the  change  in  the  governing  administration  and  the  appointment  of  new  SEC
commissioners will substantially impact the approach to enforcement by the SEC and its staff.

The SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology published a framework for analyzing whether any given crypto asset is a
security in April 2019. The SEC has also brought enforcement actions and entered into settlements with numerous cryptoeconomy participants
alleging  that  certain  digital  assets  are  securities.  More  recently,  the  SEC  dismissed  many  of  those  enforcement  actions.  These  statements,
framework and enforcement actions are not rules or regulations of the SEC and are not binding on the SEC. As noted above, whether any given
crypto asset, product or service would be ultimately deemed by a federal court to be a security is uncertain and difficult to predict. Moreover, the
SEC  and  the  Commodities  Futures  Trading  Commission  (the  “CFTC”)  and  their  senior  officials  have,  at  times,  taken  conflicting  positions  in
speeches and enforcement actions as to whether a particular crypto asset is a security or commodity.

Several  foreign  jurisdictions  have  taken  a  broad-based  approach  to  classifying  crypto  assets,  products  and  services  as  “securities,”  while
other foreign jurisdictions have adopted a narrower approach. As a result, certain crypto assets, products or services may be deemed to be a
“security” under the laws of some jurisdictions but not others. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt additional laws,

58

Table of Contents

regulations, or directives that affect the characterization of crypto assets, products or services as “securities.”

The classification of a crypto asset, product or service as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory
obligations that flow from the offer, sale, trading, and clearing, as applicable, of such assets, products or services. For example, a crypto asset,
product  or  service  that  is  a  security  in  the  United  States  may  generally  only  be  offered  or  sold  in  the  United  States  pursuant  to  a  registration
statement filed with the SEC or in an offering that qualifies for an exemption from registration. Persons that effect transactions in crypto assets,
products or services that are securities in the United States may be subject to registration with the SEC as a “broker” or “dealer.” Platforms that
bring  together  purchasers  and  sellers  to  trade  crypto  assets  that  are  securities  in  the  United  States  are  generally  subject  to  registration  as
national  securities  exchanges,  or  must  qualify  for  an  exemption,  such  as  by  being  operated  by  a  registered  broker-dealer  as  an  ATS  in
compliance  with  rules  for  ATSs.  Persons  facilitating  clearing  and  settlement  of  securities  may  be  subject  to  registration  with  the  SEC  as  a
clearing agency. Foreign jurisdictions may have similar licensing, registration, and qualification requirements.

We have policies and procedures to analyze whether each crypto asset that we seek to facilitate trading on Coinbase Spot Market, as well
as our products and services, could be deemed to be a “security” under applicable laws. Our policies and procedures do not constitute a legal
standard, but rather represent our company-developed model, which we use to make a risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a
particular crypto asset, product or service could be deemed a “security” under applicable laws.

Because Coinbase Spot Market, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase app are not registered or licensed with the SEC or foreign authorities as a
broker-dealer,  national  securities  exchange,  or ATS  (or  foreign  equivalents),  we  only  permit  trading  of  those  crypto  assets,  and  offer  products
and  services,  for  which  we  determine  there  are  reasonably  strong  arguments  to  conclude  that  the  crypto  asset,  product  or  service  is  not  a
security.  We  believe  that  our  process  reflects  a  comprehensive  and  thoughtful  analysis  and  is  reasonably  designed  to  facilitate  consistent
application  of  available  legal  guidance  on  crypto  assets,  products  and  services  and  to  facilitate  informed  risk-based  business  judgment.  In
addition, as we shared in our petition for SEC rulemaking, we remain open to registering or relying on an exemption to facilitate and offer the
sale of securities involving crypto assets. We recognize that the application of securities laws to the specific facts and circumstances of crypto
assets, products and services may be complex and subject to change, and that a listing determination does not guarantee any conclusion under
the U.S. federal securities laws. Regardless of our conclusions, we have been, and could in the future be, subject to legal or regulatory action in
the event the SEC or a state or foreign regulatory authority were to assert, or a court were to determine, that a supported crypto asset, product
or service offered, sold, or traded on our platform or a product or service that we offer is a “security” under applicable laws. There can be no
assurance that we will properly characterize over time any given crypto asset, product or service offering as a security or non-security, or that the
SEC, foreign regulatory authority, or a court having final determinative authority on the topic, if the question was presented to it, would agree with
our  assessment.  We  expect  our  risk  assessment  policies  and  procedures  to  continuously  evolve  to  take  into  account  case  law,  legislative
developments, facts, and developments in technology.

If  an  applicable  regulatory  authority  or  a  court,  in  either  case  having  final  determinative  authority  on  the  topic,  were  to  determine  that  a
supported  crypto  asset,  product  or  service  currently  offered,  sold,  or  traded  on  our  platform  is  a  security,  we  would  not  be  able  to  offer  such
crypto asset for trading, or product or service on our platform, until we are able to do so in a compliant manner. A determination by the SEC, a
state or foreign regulatory authority, or a court that an asset that we currently support for trading on our platform, or product or service that we
offer on our platform, constitutes a security may result in us removing that crypto asset from or ceasing to offer that product or service on our
platform, and may also result in us determining that it is advisable to remove assets from our platform, or to cease offering products and services
on our platform, that have similar characteristics to the asset, product or service that was alleged or determined to be a security. Alternatively, we
may determine not to remove a particular crypto asset from Coinbase Spot Market or to continue to offer a product or service on our

59

Table of Contents

platform even if the SEC or another regulator alleges that the crypto asset, product or service is a security, pending a final judicial determination
as to that crypto asset, product or service’s proper characterization, and the fact that we waited for a final judicial determination would generally
not preclude penalties or sanctions against us for our having previously made our platform available for trading that crypto asset or offering that
product or service on our platform without registering as a national securities exchange or ATS or registering tokens that we may issue, such as
our  cbETH  and  cbBTC  tokens  or  our  staking  services,  with  the  SEC. As  such,  we  could  be  subject  to  judicial  or  administrative  sanctions  for
failing to offer or sell the crypto asset, product or service in compliance with the registration requirements, or for acting as a broker, dealer, or
national securities exchange without appropriate registration. Such an action could result in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as civil
monetary penalties, fines, and disgorgement, criminal liability, and reputational harm. Customers that traded such supported crypto asset on our
platform and suffered trading losses could also seek to rescind a transaction that we facilitated on the basis that it was conducted in violation of
applicable law, which could subject us to significant liability. We may also be required to cease facilitating transactions in the supported crypto
asset other than via our licensed subsidiaries, which could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally,
the SEC has brought and may in the future bring enforcement actions against other cryptoeconomy participants and their product offerings and
services  that  may  cause  us  to  modify  or  discontinue  a  product  offering  or  service  on  our  platform.  If  we  were  to  modify  or  discontinue  any
product offering or service or remove any assets from trading on our platform for any reason, our decision may be unpopular with users, may
reduce  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  customers  (especially  if  similar  products,  services  or  such  assets  continue  to  be  offered  or  traded  on
unregulated  exchanges,  which  includes  many  of  our  competitors),  and  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition.

Further, if Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins or any other supported crypto asset is deemed to be a security under any U.S. federal, state, or
foreign jurisdiction, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have adverse consequences for such supported crypto asset. For
instance, all transactions in such supported crypto asset would have to be registered with the SEC or other foreign authority, or conducted in
accordance with an exemption from registration, which could severely limit its liquidity, usability and transactability. Moreover, the networks on
which such supported crypto assets are utilized may be required to be regulated as securities intermediaries, and subject to applicable rules,
which could effectively render the network impracticable for its existing purposes. Further, it could draw negative publicity and a decline in the
general  acceptance  of  the  crypto  asset. Also,  it  may  make  it  difficult  for  such  supported  crypto  asset  to  be  traded,  cleared,  and  custodied  as
compared to other crypto assets that are not considered to be securities. Specifically, even if transactions in such supported crypto asset were
registered with the SEC or conducted in accordance with an exemption from registration, the current intermediary-based framework for securities
trading, clearance and settlement is not consistent with the operations of the crypto asset market. For example, under current SEC guidance,
securities involving crypto assets cannot be held on behalf of customers by broker-dealers that also support custody of traditional securities; and
the SEC has not permitted public permissionless blockchain-based clearance and settlement systems for securities.

We currently rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our operations, and any interruptions in services provided by
these third parties may impair our ability to support our customers.

We rely on third parties in connection with many aspects of our business, including payment processors, financial institutions, and payment
gateways to process transactions; cloud computing services and data centers that provide facilities, infrastructure, smart contract development,
website functionality and access, components, and services, including databases and data center facilities and cloud computing; as well as third
parties that provide outsourced customer service, compliance support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations.
Because we rely on third parties to provide these services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risks.
We do not directly manage the operation of any of these third parties, including their data center facilities that we use. These third parties may be
subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues,

60

Table of Contents

cybersecurity incidents, data theft or loss, break-ins, computer viruses or vulnerabilities in their code, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of
vandalism,  loss,  disruption,  or  instability  of  third-party  financial  institution  relationships,  privacy  breaches,  service  terminations,  disruptions,
interruptions,  and  other  misconduct.  They  are  also  vulnerable  to  damage  or  interruption  from  human  error,  power  loss,  telecommunications
failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  pandemics  and  similar  events.  In  addition,  these  third  parties  may  breach  their
agreements  with  us,  disagree  with  our  interpretation  of  contract  terms  or  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  refuse  to  continue  or  renew  these
agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions
that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to
competitors. There can be no assurance that third parties that provide services to us or to our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on
acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or
our customers on our behalf, such as if third-party service providers to close their data center facilities without adequate notice, are unable to
restore operations and data, fail to perform as expected, or experience other unanticipated problems, we may be unable to procure alternatives
in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate
any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which
could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Loss of a critical financial institution or insurance relationship could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

We  rely  on  financial  institution  relationships  to  provide  our  platform  and  custodial  services.  In  particular,  customer  cash  holdings  on  our
platform are held with one or more financial institutions. As a registered money services business with FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, as
amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations enforced by FinCEN, or collectively, the BSA, a licensed money
transmitter in a number of U.S. states and territories, a licensee under NYDFS’s Virtual Currency Business Activity regime, commonly referred to
as a BitLicense, a licensed electronic money institution under both the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Central Bank of Ireland, and a
limited purpose trust company chartered by the NYDFS, our financial institution partners view us as a higher risk customer for purposes of their
anti-money  laundering  programs.  We  may  face  difficulty  establishing  or  maintaining  such  relationships  due  to  instability  in  the  global  banking
system, increasing regulatory uncertainty and scrutiny, or our partners’ policies and some prior partners have terminated their relationship with
us or have limited access to services. The loss of these partners or the imposition of operational restrictions by these partners and the inability
for us to utilize other redundant financial institutions may result in a disruption of business activity as well as regulatory risks. In addition, as a
result of the myriad of regulations or the risks of crypto assets generally, financial institutions in the United States and globally may decide to not
provide,  or  be  prohibited  from  providing,  account,  custody,  or  other  financial  services  to  us  or  the  cryptoeconomy  generally.  Further,  we  have
existing redundancies in U.S. and global financial institutions that work with crypto companies with which we engage.

However,  if  these  financial  institutions  are  subject  to  bank  resolution  or  failure,  or  limit  or  end  their  crypto  market  activity,  or  if  such
relationships  become  severely  limited  or  unavailable  to  crypto  market  participants  in  a  certain  country,  there  could  be  temporary  delays  in  or
unavailability of services in such country that are critical to our or our partners’ operations, developers or customers, a further limit on available
vendors,  reduced  quality  in  services  we,  our  partners,  our  developers  or  our  customers  are  able  to  obtain,  and  a  general  disruption  to  the
cryptoeconomy, potentially leading to reduced activity on our platform which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.  For  example,  while  our  business  and  operations  have  not  been  materially  affected  by  the  closures  of  Silvergate  Capital  Corp.  and
Signature Bank and the cessation of their real-time fiat currency payment networks in March 2023, large cryptoeconomy participants, including
us and our institutional customers, experienced a temporary inability to transfer fiat currencies outside of standard business hours.

We also rely on insurance carriers to insure customer losses resulting from a breach of our physical security, cybersecurity, or by employee
or  third  party  theft  and  hold  surety  bonds  as  required  for  compliance  with  certain  of  our  licenses  under  applicable  state  laws.  Our  ability  to
maintain crime, specie, and cyber insurance, as well as surety bonds, is subject to the insurance carriers’ ongoing underwriting criteria and our
inability  to  obtain  and  maintain  appropriate  insurance  coverage  could  cause  a  substantial  business  disruption,  adverse  reputational  impact,
inability  to  compete  with  our  competitors,  and  regulatory  scrutiny,  and  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition.

Any significant disruption in our products and services, in our information technology systems, or in any of the blockchain networks
we support, could result in a loss of customers or funds and adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and
financial condition.

Our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and grow our business depends on our ability to operate our service at high levels
of reliability, scalability, and performance, including the ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions that occur
at high volume and frequencies across multiple systems. For example, in March 2023, there was a temporary disruption to USDC services for
several days following the news of Silicon Valley Bank’s closure. Our platform, the ability of our customers to trade, and our ability to operate at a
high  level,  are  dependent  on  our  ability  to  access  the  blockchain  networks  underlying  the  supported  crypto  assets,  for  which  access  is
dependent  on  our  systems’  ability  to  access  the  internet.  Further,  the  successful  and  continued  operations  of  such  blockchain  networks  will
depend on a network of computers, miners, or validators, and their continued operations, all of which may be impacted by service interruptions.

Our  systems,  the  systems  of  our  third-party  service  providers  and  partners,  and  certain  crypto  asset  and  blockchain  networks  have
experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects
or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, break-ins, sabotage, human error, vandalism, earthquakes,
hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  and  other  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  in  telecommunications  services,  fraud,  military  or  political
conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. In addition, extraordinary Trading Volumes or site usage could
cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Some of our systems, including systems of companies we
have  acquired,  or  the  systems  of  our  third-party  service  providers  and  partners  are  not  fully  redundant,  and  our  or  their  disaster  recovery
planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events.

If any of our systems, or those of our third-party service providers, are disrupted for any reason, our products and services may fail, resulting
in  unanticipated  disruptions,  slower  response  times  and  delays  in  our  customers’  trade  execution  and  processing,  failed  settlement  of  trades,
incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades, unauthorized trades, loss of customer information, increased demand on
limited customer support resources, customer claims, complaints with regulatory organizations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions. Further, when
these disruptions occur, we have in the past, and may in the future, fulfill customer transactions using inventory to prevent adverse user impact
and  limit  detrimental  impact  to  our  operating  results.  A  prolonged  interruption  in  the  availability  or  reduction  in  the  availability,  speed,  or
functionality of our products and services could harm our business. Significant or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or
potential customers or partners to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the
use  of  our  products  and  services,  and  could  permanently  harm  our  reputation  and  brands.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  any  system  failure  or
similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation
or  contractual  penalties  from  us  for  their  losses,  and  those  claims,  even  if  unsuccessful,  would  likely  be  time-consuming  and  costly  for  us  to
address.  Problems  with  the  reliability  or  security  of  our  systems  would  harm  our  reputation  and  the  cost  of  remedying  these  problems  could
negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

62

Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, interruptions have resulted and in the future may result in regulatory
scrutiny,  and  significant  or  persistent  interruptions  could  lead  to  significant  fines  and  penalties,  and  mandatory  and  costly  changes  to  our
business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses or financial institution relationships that we need to operate or prevent
or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.

In  addition,  we  are  continually  improving  and  upgrading  our  information  systems  and  technologies.  Implementation  of  new  systems  and
technologies is complex, expensive, time-consuming, and may not be successful. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information
systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies
do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), and our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Our failure to securely store and manage our and our customers’ fiat currencies and crypto assets could adversely affect our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

We hold cash and store crypto assets on behalf of our customers and hold fiat and crypto for corporate investment and operating purposes.
In addition, following the acquisition of Coinbase Asset Management, formerly One River Digital Asset Management (“CBAM”), we additionally
store an immaterial amount of cryptocurrencies at third-party custodians for asset management products.

Securely storing customers’ cash and crypto assets is integral to the trust we build with our customers. We believe our policies, procedures,
operational controls and controls over financial reporting, protect us from material risks surrounding the storing of these assets and conflicts of
interest.  Our  controls  over  financial  reporting  include  among  others,  controls  over  the  segregation  of  corporate  crypto  asset  balances  from
customer  crypto  asset  balances,  controls  over  the  processes  of  customer  crypto  asset  deposits  and  customer  crypto  asset  withdrawals  and
corporate and customer fiat balances. Our financial statements and disclosures, as a whole, are available through periodic filings on a quarterly
basis, and compliant with annual audit requirements of Article 3 of Regulation S-X.

We hold cash at financial institutions in accounts designated as for the benefit of our customers. We have also entered into partnerships or
joint ventures with third parties, such as with Circle, where we or our partners receive and hold customer funds. Our and our financial partners’
abilities to manage and accurately hold customer cash and cash we hold for our own investment and operating purposes requires a high level of
internal controls. We are limited in our ability to influence or manage the controls and processes of third-party partners or vendors and may be
dependent on our partners’ and vendors’ operations, liquidity and financial condition to manage these risks. As we maintain, grow and expand
our product and services offerings we also must scale and strengthen our internal controls and processes, and monitor our third-party partners’
and  vendors’  ability  to  similarly  scale  and  strengthen.  Failure  to  do  so  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition. This is important both to the actual controls and processes and the public perception of the same.

Any inability by us to maintain our procedures, perceived or otherwise, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Accordingly, we take steps to ensure customer cash is always secure. Customer cash and crypto asset balances are maintained through our
internal ledgering processes. Customer cash is maintained in segregated Company financial institution accounts that are held for the exclusive
benefit  of  customers  with  our  financial  institution  partners  or  in  government  money  market  funds  or  other  permissible  investments.  We  store
crypto  assets  using  proprietary  technology  and  operational  processes.  Crypto  assets  are  not  insured  or  guaranteed  by  any  government  or
government agency, however we have worked hard to securely store our customers’ crypto assets and our own crypto assets for investment and
operational purposes with legal and operational protections.

Any material failure by us or our partners to maintain the necessary controls, policies, procedures or to manage the crypto assets we hold for
our  own  investment  and  operating  purposes  could  also  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Further,  any
material failure by us or our

63

Table of Contents

partners  to  maintain  the  necessary  controls  or  to  manage  customer  crypto  assets  and  funds  appropriately  and  in  compliance  with  applicable
regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, significant financial losses, lead customers
to discontinue or reduce their use of our and our partners’ products, and result in significant penalties and fines and additional restrictions, which
could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Moreover,  because  custodially  held  crypto  assets  may  be
considered  to  be  the  property  of  a  bankruptcy  estate,  in  the  event  of  a  bankruptcy,  the  crypto  assets  we  hold  in  custody  on  behalf  of  our
customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors. This may result
in  customers  finding  our  custodial  services  more  risky  and  less  attractive  and  any  failure  to  increase  our  customer  base,  discontinuation  or
reduction  in  use  of  our  platform  and  products  by  existing  customers  as  a  result  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and
financial condition. Additionally, following the acquisition of CBAM, some of our asset management products hold customer assets at third-party
custodians with their own bankruptcy protection procedures.

We place great importance on securely storing crypto assets we custody and keeping them bankruptcy remote from our general creditors,
and in June 2022 we updated our Retail User Agreement to clarify the applicability of UCC Article 8 to custodied crypto assets – the same legal
protection that our institutional custody and prime broker clients also rely upon. UCC Article 8 provides that financial assets held by Coinbase are
not property of Coinbase and not subject to the claims of its general creditors. In light of UCC Article 8, we believe that a court would not treat
custodied crypto assets as part of our general estate; however, due to the novelty of crypto assets, courts have not yet considered this type of
treatment for custodied crypto assets.

We deposit, transfer, and custody customer cash and crypto assets in multiple jurisdictions. In each instance, we require bank-level security
encryption to store customers’ assets for our wallet and storage systems, as well as our financial management systems related to such custodial
functions.  Our  security  technology  is  designed  to  prevent,  detect,  and  mitigate  inappropriate  access  to  our  systems,  by  internal  or  external
threats.  We  believe  we  have  developed  and  maintained  administrative,  technical,  and  physical  measures  designed  to  comply  with  applicable
legal requirements and industry standards. However, it is nevertheless possible that hackers, employees or service providers acting contrary to
our policies, or others could circumvent these measures to improperly access our systems or documents, or the systems or documents of our
business partners, agents, or service providers, and improperly access, obtain, or misuse customer crypto assets and funds. The methods used
to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult
to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Certain of our customer contracts do not limit our liability with respect to security breaches and
other security-related matters and our insurance coverage for such impropriety is limited and may not cover the extent of loss nor the nature of
such  loss,  in  which  case  we  may  be  liable  for  the  full  amount  of  losses  suffered,  which  could  be  greater  than  all  of  our  assets.  Our  ability  to
maintain insurance is also subject to the insurance carriers’ ongoing underwriting criteria. Any loss of customer cash or crypto assets could result
in  a  subsequent  lapse  in  insurance  coverage,  which  could  cause  a  substantial  business  disruption,  adverse  reputational  impact,  inability  to
compete with our competitors, and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or actions. Additionally, transactions undertaken through our websites or
other  electronic  channels  may  create  risks  of  fraud,  hacking,  unauthorized  access  or  acquisition,  and  other  deceptive  practices. Any  security
incident resulting in a compromise of customer assets could result in substantial costs to us and require us to notify impacted individuals, and in
some cases regulators, of a possible or actual incident, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions, including substantial fines, limit our ability
to  provide  services,  subject  us  to  litigation,  significant  financial  losses,  damage  our  reputation,  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating
results, financial condition, and cash flows.

The theft, loss, or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account or for our
customers may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our

64

Table of Contents

private keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our ability to access any crypto assets, it could cause regulatory
scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses.

Crypto  assets  are  generally  controllable  only  by  the  possessor  of  the  unique  private  key  relating  to  the  digital  wallet  in  which  the  crypto
assets are held. While blockchain protocols typically require public addresses to be published when used in a transaction, private keys must be
secured and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the crypto assets held in such a wallet. To the extent that any of the
private  keys  relating  to  our  wallets  containing  crypto  assets  held  for  our  own  account  or  for  our  customers  is  lost,  destroyed,  or  otherwise
compromised or unavailable, and no backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the crypto assets held in the related
wallet.  Further,  we  cannot  provide  assurance  that  our  wallets  will  not  be  hacked  or  compromised.  Crypto  assets  and  blockchain  technologies
have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking, or other malicious activities. Any loss of private keys relating to, or
hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our customers’ crypto assets could adversely affect our customers’ ability to access or
sell their crypto assets, require us to reimburse our customers for their losses, and subject us to significant financial losses in addition to losing
customer  trust  in  us  and  our  products. As  such,  any  loss  of  private  keys  due  to  a  hack,  employee  or  service  provider  misconduct  or  error,  or
other compromise by third parties could hurt our brand and reputation, result in significant losses, and adversely affect our business, operating
results, and financial condition.

To  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  the  loss  or  theft  of  keys,  we  utilize  both  hot  wallets  and  cold  wallets  in  our  custodial  solutions.  We
actively manage wallet balances and generally seek to hold no more than 2% of custodied assets in hot wallets at any given time. Cold wallet
private key materials are stored and secured at facilities within the United States and internationally. We store the substantial majority of our own
crypto  asset  holdings  utilizing  the  same  storage  solutions  that  we  provide  to  our  customers.  In  limited  cases,  we  use  storage  solutions  not
offered  to  our  customers  to  store  immaterial  amounts  of  crypto  held  for  corporate  purposes  outside  of  our  core  custodial  product  offerings.
Additionally, our CBAM offering utilizes both Coinbase and third parties as custodians.

At all times, we hold corporate assets in excess of the total amount of assets held in our hot wallets. Similar to most financial institutions, the
total customer assets on our platform, such as those assets held in cold storage, are substantially more than our corporate assets and available
insurance.  While  we  have  for  years  maintained,  and  continue  to  maintain,  a  commercial  crime  insurance  policy,  which  has  a  one-year  term
without  automatic  renewals,  in  the  event  of  a  loss  from  our  cold  wallets,  our  assets  may  be  insufficient  to  cover  amounts  that  exceed  our
insurance  coverage.  We  may  be  liable  for  such  uninsured  losses  where  we  are  required  to  reimburse  customers,  and  such  liability  could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Other Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position

If we fail to retain existing customers or add new customers, or if our customers decrease their level of engagement with our
products, services and platform, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be significantly harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, including developers, to increase engagement
with our products, services, and platform. To do so, we must continue to offer leading technologies and ensure that our products and services
are secure, reliable, and engaging. We must also expand our products and services, and offer competitive prices in an increasingly crowded and
price-sensitive market. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so, that we will be able to retain our current customers or
attract  new  customers,  or  keep  our  customers  engaged.  Any  number  of  factors  can  negatively  affect  customer  retention,  growth,  and
engagement, including if:

•

customers increasingly engage with competing products and services, including products and services that we are unable to offer due to
regulatory reasons;

65

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

we fail to introduce new and improved products and services, or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received;

we fail to support new and in-demand crypto assets or if we elect to support crypto assets with negative reputations;

there are changes in sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products and services or concerns related to privacy, security, fiat
pegging or other factors;

there are adverse changes in our products and services that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation;

customers perceive the crypto assets on our platform to be bad investments, or experience significant losses in investments made on
our platform;

technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products and services with the speed, functionality, security, and reliability that
our customers expect;

cybersecurity incidents, employee or service provider misconduct, or other unforeseen activities cause losses to us or our customers,
including losses to assets held by us on behalf of our customers;

• modifications to our pricing model or modifications by competitors to their pricing models;

•

•

•

we fail to provide adequate customer service;

regulatory  and  governmental  bodies  in  countries  that  we  target  for  expansion  express  negative  views  towards  crypto  asset  trading
platforms and, more broadly, the cryptoeconomy; or

we or other companies or high-profile figures in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity.

From time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected customer retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we
are unable to maintain or increase our customer base and customer engagement, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected.
Any  decrease  in  user  retention,  growth,  or  engagement  could  render  our  products  and  services  less  attractive  to  customers  and  lead  to  a
decrease in revenue, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. If our customer growth rate slows
or declines, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to
drive growth of revenue.

Our operating expenses may increase in the future and we may not be successful in increasing our revenue to sufficiently offset these
higher expenses, which could impact our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow from operations on a consistent basis
and cause our business, operating results, and financial condition to be adversely affected.

Our operating expenses may increase in the future as we continue to grow our business. While we consistently evaluate opportunities to
drive efficiency, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that we will not need to accelerate operating expenditures in the
future.  Our  operations  may  prove  more  expensive  than  we  currently  anticipate,  and  we  may  not  succeed  in  increasing  our  net  revenue
sufficiently  to  offset  these  higher  expenses.  Additionally,  our  revenue  growth  may  be  negatively  impacted  by,  among  other  things,  reduced
demand for our offerings, increased competition, adverse macroeconomic conditions, any decrease in the growth or size of the cryptoeconomy,
regulatory uncertainty or scrutiny, changes that impact our ability to offer certain products or services, or failure of new products and services to
gain market adoption. As a result, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve profitability or achieve positive operating cash flow on any
quarterly  or  annual  basis.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  these  risks  and  difficulties  as  we  encounter  them,  our  business,  operating
results, and financial condition may suffer.

If we do not effectively manage our growth, including by maintaining and improving our systems and processes, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We have experienced, and may experience in the future, periods of significant growth. To effectively manage and capitalize on our growth
periods,  we  will  need  to  manage  headcount,  capital,  and  processes  efficiently  while  making  investments  such  as  expanding  our  information
technology  and  financial,  operating,  and  administrative  systems  and  controls,  and  such  initiatives  could  strain  our  resources.  We  could
experience operating difficulties in managing our business as it expands across numerous jurisdictions, including difficulties in hiring, training,
managing  and  retaining  a  remote  and  evolving  employee  base.  If  we  do  not  adapt  or  scale  to  meet  these  evolving  challenges,  we  may
experience erosion to our brand, the quality of our products and services may suffer, and our company culture may be harmed. Moreover, the
failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate, timely, and reliable reports on our financial and operating
results, including the financial statements provided herein, and could impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In
addition,  our  systems  and  processes  may  not  prevent  or  detect  all  errors,  omissions,  or  fraud. Any  of  the  foregoing  operational  failures  could
lead to noncompliance with laws and regulations, loss of operating licenses or other authorizations, or loss of financial institution relationships
that could substantially impair or even suspend company operations.

Successful  implementation  of  our  growth  strategy  will  also  require  significant  expenditures  before  any  substantial  associated  revenue  is
generated and we cannot guarantee that these increased investments will result in corresponding and offsetting revenue growth. Because we
have a limited history operating our business at its current scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, including our
ability to plan for and model future growth. Our limited operating experience at this scale, combined with the rapidly evolving and volatile nature
of  the  crypto  asset  market  in  which  we  operate,  and  other  economic  factors  beyond  our  control,  reduces  our  ability  to  accurately  forecast
quarterly or annual revenue.

Additionally,  from  time  to  time,  we  have  realigned  our  resources  and  talent  to  implement  stage-appropriate  business  strategies,  including
layoffs and reductions in force. For example, in June 2022 and in January 2023, in response to rapidly changing economic conditions and in an
effort  to  reduce  our  operational  costs  and  improve  our  organizational  efficiency,  we  reduced  our  workforce.  If  there  are  unforeseen  expenses
associated  with  such  realignments  in  our  business  strategies,  and  we  incur  unanticipated  charges  or  liabilities,  then  we  may  not  be  able  to
effectively  realize  the  expected  cost  savings  or  other  benefits  of  such  actions.  Failure  to  manage  any  growth  or  any  scaling  back  of  our
operations could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our strategy and focus on delivering high-quality, compliant, easy-to-use, and secure crypto-related financial services may not
maximize short-term or medium-term financial results.

We have taken, and expect to continue to take, actions that we believe are in the best interests of our customers and the long-term interests
of  our  business,  even  if  those  actions  do  not  necessarily  maximize  short-term  or  medium-term  results.  These  include  expending  significant
managerial, technical, and legal efforts on complying with laws and regulations that are applicable to our products and services and ensuring
that  our  products  are  secure.  We  also  focus  on  driving  long-term  engagement  with  our  customers  through  innovation  and  developing  new
industry-leading  products  and  technologies. These  decisions  may  not  be  consistent  with  the  short-term  and  medium-term  expectations  of  our
stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

Laws and regulations regarding conflicts of interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics, digital engagement practices,
and similar technologies, if adopted and found to be applicable to our business, may require us to modify, limit, or discontinue our
use of certain technologies and features contained within our products and services and may impact the way

67

Table of Contents

that we interact with existing and prospective customers, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Our  products,  services  and  educational  offerings  incorporate  a  holistic,  customer-centric  set  of  digital  engagement  practices,  including
educational  content  and  notifications,  which  are  designed,  in  part,  to  promote  financial  literacy  and  awareness  and  to  provide  customers  with
guidance  and  information  to  help  them  make  better  informed  decisions  about  their  crypto  activity.  Certain  jurisdictions  have  proposed  or  are
considering laws and regulations regarding conflicts of interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics, digital engagement practices,
and similar technologies by broker-dealers, investment advisers and/or other securities market participants. For example, in July 2023 the SEC
proposed  rules  (the  “July  2023  Rule  Proposals”)  that  would  impose  new  obligations  on  broker-dealers  and  investment  advisers  registered,  or
required  to  be  registered,  with  the  SEC  with  respect  to  conflicts  of  interest  associated  with  the  use  of  predictive  data  analytics  and  similar
technologies when interacting with investors. We do not believe that the July 2023 Rule Proposals, if adopted as proposed, would apply to our
business. If the July 2023 Rule Proposals were to be adopted (as proposed or otherwise) and found to apply to our business, or if similar rules
were  to  be  adopted  and  found  to  apply  to  our  business  in  any  other  jurisdiction  in  which  we  operate,  we  may  be  required  to  modify,  limit,  or
discontinue our use of certain technologies and features used in connection with our products and services and/or to change the way that we
interact with existing and prospective customers. The adoption of such laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could, if they
are deemed to apply to our business, adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

A significant amount of the Trading Volume on our platform is derived from a relatively small number of users, and the loss of these
users, or a reduction in their Trading Volume, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

A relatively small number of institutional market makers and high-transaction volume consumer customers account for a significant amount
of the Trading Volume on our platform and our net revenue. We expect significant Trading Volume and net revenue attributable to these users for
the foreseeable future. As a result, a loss of these users, or a reduction in their Trading Volume, and our inability to replace these users with
other users, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Due to our limited operating history, it may be difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects, and we may not be able to
achieve or maintain profitability in any given period.

We began our operations in 2012 and since then our business model has continued to evolve. Our net revenue has significantly grown since
our formation, but there is no assurance that growth will continue in future periods and you should not rely on growth of our revenue in any given
prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. For example, while we generated $7.4 billion in net revenue for the
year  ended  December  31,  2021,  our  net  revenue  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023  and  2022  declined  to  $2.9  billion  and  $3.1  billion,
respectively,  primarily  due  to  declining  crypto  prices,  lower  crypto  asset  volatility,  and  uncertainty  in  the  cryptoeconomy  following  the  2022
Events, before increasing to $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. If our net revenue were to decline significantly for any extended
period of time, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our limited operating history and the volatile
nature  of  our  business  make  it  difficult  to  evaluate  our  current  business  and  our  future  prospects.  We  have  encountered  and  will  continue  to
encounter risks and difficulties as described in this section. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business, operating results, and
financial condition could be adversely affected.

Because our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our sales to customers outside the United States, our
business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.

We currently have subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. We plan to enter into or increase our presence in additional markets around
the world. We have a limited operating history outside the United States, and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations
internationally  requires  considerable  management  attention  and  resources  and  is  subject  to  particular  challenges  of  supporting  a  growing
business in an environment of diverse cultures, languages, customs, tax laws, legal systems, alternate dispute systems, and regulatory systems.
As we continue to expand our business and customer base outside the United States, we will be increasingly susceptible to risks associated with
international operations. These risks and challenges include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

difficulty establishing and managing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure, including establishment
of  local  customer  service  operations,  local  infrastructure  to  manage  supported  cryptocurrency  or  other  financial  instruments  and
corresponding books and records, and legal and regulatory compliance costs associated with different jurisdictions;

the need to vary pricing and margins to effectively compete in international markets;

the  need  to  adapt  and  localize  our  products  and  services  for  specific  countries,  including  offering  services  and  support  in  local
languages;

compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations across different jurisdictions;

compliance  with  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  designed  to  combat  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorist  activities,  as  well  as
economic and trade sanctions;

the need to comply with a greater set of law enforcement inquiries including those subject to mutual legal assistance treaties;

compliance with the extraterritorial reach of any U.S. regulatory rules, including those imposed by the CFTC, SEC, FinCEN or other U.S.
based regulators;

difficulties obtaining and maintaining required licensing from regulators in foreign jurisdictions;

competition with companies that have greater experience in the local markets, pre-existing relationships with customers in these markets
or are subject to less regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;

varying  levels  of  payments  and  blockchain  technology  adoption  and  infrastructure,  and  increased  network,  payment  processing,
banking, and other costs;

compliance  with  anti-bribery  laws,  including  compliance  with  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices Act,  the  U.K.  Bribery Act  2010,  and  other
local anticorruption laws;

difficulties collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;

difficulties holding, repatriating, and transferring funds held in offshore bank accounts;

difficulties adapting to foreign customary commercial practices, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, longer payment
cycles and other collection difficulties;

restrictions on crypto asset trading;

stringent local labor laws and regulations;

potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;

antitrust and competition regulations; and

regional economic and political conditions.

We  have  limited  experience  with  international  regulatory  environments  and  market  practices  and  may  not  be  able  to  penetrate  or
successfully operate in the markets we choose to enter. In addition, we may incur significant expenses as a result of our international expansion,
and we may not be successful. We may face limited brand recognition in certain parts of the world that could lead to non-acceptance or delayed
acceptance  of  our  products  and  services  by  customers  in  new  markets.  We  may  also  face  challenges  in  complying  with  local  laws  and
regulations. For example, we may be subject to regulatory frameworks that are evolving, have not undergone extensive rulemaking, and could
result  in  uncertain  outcomes  for  our  customers  and/or  our  ability  to  offer  competitive  products  in  the  broader  cryptoeconomy.  Our  failure  to
successfully  manage  these  risks  could  harm  our  international  operations  and  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results,  and
financial condition.

Disputes with our customers could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

From time to time we have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and disputes with our customers with respect to our products
and services, such as regarding the execution and settlement of crypto asset trades, fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, account takeovers,
deposits and withdrawals of crypto assets, failures or malfunctions of our systems and services, or other issues relating to our products services.
For example, during periods of heavy Trading Volumes, we have received increased customer complaints. Additionally, the ingenuity of criminal
fraudsters, combined with many consumer users’ susceptibility to fraud, may cause our customers to be subject to ongoing account takeovers
and identity fraud issues. While we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, there is no guarantee that they will be successful
and,  in  any  case,  require  continuous  improvement  and  optimization  for  continually  evolving  forms  of  fraud  to  be  effective.  There  can  be  no
guarantee that we will be successful in detecting and resolving these disputes or defending ourselves in any of these matters, and any failure
may  result  in  impaired  relationships  with  our  customers,  damage  to  our  brand  and  reputation,  and  substantial  fines  and  damages.  In  some
cases,  the  measures  we  have  implemented  to  detect  and  deter  fraud  have  led  to  poor  customer  experiences,  including  indefinite  account
inaccessibility for some of our customers, which increases our customer support costs and can compound damages. We could incur significant
costs in compensating our customers, such as if a transaction was unauthorized, erroneous, or fraudulent. We could also incur significant legal
expenses resolving and defending claims, even those without merit. To the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations,
we  could  also  lose  our  authorizations  or  licenses  or  become  subject  to  conditions  that  could  make  future  operations  more  costly,  impair  our
ability  to  grow,  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  We  currently  are,  or  may  in  the  future  become,
subject  to  investigation  and  enforcement  action  by  state,  federal,  and  international  consumer  protection  agencies,  including  the  Consumer
Financial  Protection  Bureau,  the  Federal Trade  Commission  (the  “FTC”),  state  agencies  and  attorneys  general  in  the  United  States,  the  U.K.
Financial  Conduct Authority,  the  U.K.  Financial  Ombudsman  Service,  and  the  U.K.  Office  of  Fair  Trading,  each  of  which  monitors  customer
complaints against us and, from time to time, escalates matters for investigation and potential enforcement against us.

While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to
consumer class action litigation, some federal, state, and foreign courts have refused or may refuse to enforce one or more of these provisions,
and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in
the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-
dispute  arbitration  clauses  and  class  action  waiver  provisions.  Any  such  prohibitions  or  limitations  on  or  discontinuation  of  the  use  of  such
arbitration  or  class  action  waiver  provisions  could  subject  us  to  additional  lawsuits,  including  additional  consumer  class  action  litigation,  and
significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation.

We may suffer losses due to staking, delegating, and other related services we provide to our customers.

Certain supported crypto assets enable holders to earn rewards by participating in decentralized governance, bookkeeping and transaction
confirmation  activities  on  their  underlying  blockchain  networks,  such  as  through  staking  activities,  including  staking  through  validation,
delegating,  and  baking.  We  currently  provide  and  expect  to  continue  to  provide  such  services  for  certain  supported  crypto  assets  to  our
customers in order to enable them to earn rewards based on crypto assets that we hold on their behalf. For instance, as a service to customers
and  at  their  instruction,  we  operate  staking  nodes  on  certain  blockchain  networks  utilizing  customers’  crypto  assets  and  pass  through  the
rewards received to those customers, less a service fee. In other cases, upon customers’ instructions, we may delegate our customers’ assets to
third-party  service  providers  that  are  unaffiliated  with  us.  Some  networks  may  further  require  customer  assets  to  be  transferred  into  smart
contracts on the underlying blockchain networks not under our or anyone’s control. If our validator, any third-party service providers, or smart
contracts  fail  to  behave  as  expected,  suffer  cybersecurity  attacks,  experience  security  issues,  or  encounter  other  problems,  our  customers’
assets  may  be  irretrievably  lost.  In  addition,  certain  blockchain  networks  dictate  requirements  for  participation  in  the  relevant  decentralized
governance activity, and may impose penalties, or “slashing,” if the relevant activities are not performed correctly, such as if the staker, delegator,
or  baker  acts  maliciously  on  the  network,  “double  signs”  any  transactions,  or  experience  extended  downtimes.  If  we  or  any  of  our  service
providers  are  slashed  by  the  underlying  blockchain  network,  our  customers’  assets  may  be  confiscated,  withdrawn,  or  burnt  by  the  network,
resulting  in  losses  for  which  we  may  be  responsible.  Furthermore,  certain  types  of  staking  require  the  payment  of  transaction  fees  on  the
underlying blockchain network and such fees can become significant as the amount and complexity of the transaction grows, depending on the
degree of network congestion and the price of the network token. If we experience a high volume of such staking requests from our customers
on  an  ongoing  basis,  we  could  incur  significant  costs. Any  penalties  or  slashing  events  could  damage  our  brand  and  reputation,  cause  us  to
suffer  financial  losses,  discourage  existing  and  future  customers  from  utilizing  our  products  and  services,  and  adversely  affect  our  business,
operating results, and financial condition.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations, including our obligations under the 2026
Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes.

Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes, and
our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions
and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities
sufficient  to  permit  us  to  pay  the  principal,  premium,  if  any,  and  interest  on  our  indebtedness,  including  each  series  of  the  2026  Convertible
Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes, and other obligations.

If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our
debt  obligations  prior  to  maturity.  Our  ability  to  refinance  or  restructure  our  debt  and  other  obligations  will  depend  upon  the  condition  of  the
capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to
comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also
limit our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to us. For these reasons, we may not have access to any
assets or cash flows of our subsidiaries to make interest and principal payments on each series of the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible
Notes, and Senior Notes.

If our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations on
commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all,  we  could  face  substantial  liquidity  problems  and  may  be  forced  to  reduce  or  delay  investments  and
capital expenditures, or to sell

71

Table of Contents

material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these
alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other
obligations  when  due.  If  it  becomes  necessary  to  implement  any  of  these  alternative  measures,  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition could be adversely affected.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent
us from fulfilling our obligations under the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $4.28 billion in aggregate
principal amount of outstanding long-term indebtedness (excluding crypto asset borrowings), which includes $1.74 billion of our Senior Notes,
$1.27 billion of our 2026 Convertible Notes, and $1.27 billion of our 2030 Convertible Notes.

Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations may:

• make  it  difficult  for  us  to  satisfy  our  financial  obligations,  including  making  scheduled  principal  and  interest  payments  on  our  2026

Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, Senior Notes, and our other obligations;

•

•

•

•

•

•

limit our ability to use our cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;

increase our cost of borrowing;

require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations
when due;

limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and

increase  our  vulnerability  to  the  impact  of  adverse  economic  and  industry  conditions,  including  changes  in  interest  rates  and  foreign
exchange rates.

We provide secured loans to our customers, which exposes us to credit risks and may cause us to incur financial or reputational
harm.

We provide commercial loans to qualified customers secured by their fiat or crypto asset holdings, including USDC, on our platform, which
exposes us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans. In addition, such activity results in us being subject to certain lending laws
and regulations in the applicable jurisdiction and as a result we may be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny. In the future we may enter into
credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain more capital. Any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to
us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified customers to the extent we rely on such credit lines to continue to offer or to grow such
products. Further, our credit approval process, pricing, loss forecasting, and scoring models may contain errors or may not adequately assess
creditworthiness of our borrowers, or may be otherwise ineffective, resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans. It is also possible that loan
applicants could provide false or incorrect information. While we have procedures in place to manage our credit risk, such as conducting due
diligence on our customers and running stress test simulations to monitor and manage exposures, including any exposures resulting from loans
collateralized  with  crypto  assets,  we  remain  subject  to  risks  associated  with  our  borrowers’  creditworthiness  and  our  approval  process.  Such
risks are heightened following the 2022 Events.

Borrower  loan  loss  rates  may  be  significantly  affected  by  economic  downturns  or  general  economic  conditions  beyond  our  control  and
beyond the control of individual borrowers. In particular, loss rates on loans may increase due to factors such as prevailing market conditions in
the cryptoeconomy, the price of

72

Table of Contents

Bitcoin  and  other  crypto  assets,  which  have  experienced  significant  fluctuations,  the  amount  of  liquidity  in  the  markets,  and  other  factors.
Borrowers may seek protection under federal bankruptcy law or similar laws. If a borrower of a loan files for bankruptcy (or becomes the subject
of an involuntary petition), a stay may go into effect that will automatically put any pending collection actions on the loan on hold and prevent
further  collection  action  absent  bankruptcy  court  approval. The  efficacy  of  our  security  interest  in  customer  collateral  is  not  guaranteed  under
applicable state law or the Uniform Commercial Code and therefore we may be exposed to loss in the event of a customer default, even if we
appear to be secured against such default. While we have not incurred any material losses to date, if any of the foregoing events were to occur,
our  reputation  and  relationships  with  borrowers,  and  our  financial  results,  could  be  harmed.  We  intend  to  continue  to  explore  other  products,
models, and structures for offering commercial financing, and other forms of credit and loan products. Some of those models or structures may
require, or be deemed to require, additional data, procedures, partnerships, licenses, regulatory approvals, or capabilities that we have not yet
obtained or developed.

We are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks, refunds, or returns as a result of fraud or uncollectability that could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Certain  of  our  products  and  services  are  paid  for  by  electronic  transfers  from  bank  accounts,  which  exposes  us  to  risks  associated  with
returns  and  insufficient  funds.  Furthermore,  some  of  our  products  and  services  are  paid  for  by  credit  and  debit  cards  through  payment
processors, which exposes us to risks associated with chargebacks and refunds. These risks could arise from fraud, misuse, unintentional use,
settlement  delay,  insufficiency  of  funds,  or  other  activities.  Also,  criminals  are  using  increasingly  sophisticated  methods  to  engage  in  illegal
activities, such as counterfeiting and fraud. If we are unable to collect such amounts from the customer, or if the customer refuses or is unable,
due to bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us, we bear the loss for the amount of the chargeback, refund, or return.

While we have policies and procedures to manage and mitigate these risks, we cannot be certain that such processes will be effective. Our
failure to limit chargebacks and fraudulent transactions could increase the number of returns, refunds, and chargebacks that we have to process.
In addition, if the number of returns, refunds, and chargebacks increases, card networks or our financial institution partners could require us to
increase reserves, impose penalties on us, charge additional or higher fees, or terminate their relationships with us. Failure to effectively manage
risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback, refund, and return losses or cause us to incur other liabilities. Increases in chargebacks,
refunds, returns, or other liabilities could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

We route orders through third-party trading venues in connection with our Coinbase Prime trading service. The loss or failure of any
such trading venues could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In  connection  with  our  Prime  trading  service,  we  routinely  route  customer  orders  to  third-party  exchanges  or  other  trading  venues.  In
connection with these activities, we generally hold cash and other crypto assets with such third-party exchanges or other trading venues in order
to  effect  customer  orders.  If  we  were  to  experience  a  disruption  in  our  access  to  these  third-party  exchanges  and  trading  venues,  our  Prime
trading  service  could  be  adversely  affected  to  the  extent  that  we  are  limited  in  our  ability  to  execute  order  flow  for  our  Prime  customers.  In
addition, while we have policies and procedures to help mitigate our risks related to routing orders through third-party trading venues, if any of
these  third-party  trading  venues  experience  any  technical,  legal,  regulatory,  or  other  adverse  events,  such  as  shutdowns,  delays,  system
failures, suspension of withdrawals, illiquidity, insolvency, or loss of customer assets, we might not be able to fully recover the cash and other
crypto assets that we have deposited with these third parties, and these risks may be heightened following the 2022 Events. For example, in
connection  with  the  2022  Events,  we  were  not  able  to  recover  an  immaterial  amount  of  cash  deposited  at  FTX.  As  a  result,  our  business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Any acquisitions and investments that we make could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in
dilution to our stockholders, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As  part  of  our  business  strategy,  we  routinely  conduct  discussions  and  evaluate  opportunities  for  possible  acquisitions,  strategic
investments, entries into new businesses, joint ventures, and other transactions. We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of and
investments in, among other things, specialized employees and complementary companies, products, services, licenses, or technologies. In the
future, the pace and scale of our acquisitions may increase and may include larger acquisitions than we have done historically. We also invest in
companies and technologies, many of which are private companies and technologies that are highly speculative in nature. In the future, we may
not be able to find other suitable acquisition and investment candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or make investments
on favorable terms, if at all. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions and investments may be substantial, and there is no assurance that
we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisitions and investments. We have and may in the future be required to write off
acquisitions  or  investments.  Moreover,  our  previous  and  future  acquisitions  and  investments  may  not  achieve  our  goals,  and  any  future
acquisitions and investments we complete could be viewed negatively by customers, developers, advertisers, or investors. In addition, if we fail
to successfully close or integrate any acquisitions, or integrate the products or technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company,
our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected.  Our  ability  to  acquire  and  integrate  companies,  products,
services,  licenses,  employees,  or  technologies  in  a  successful  manner  is  unproven. Any  integration  process  may  require  significant  time  and
resources,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  manage  the  process  successfully,  including  successfully  securing  regulatory  approvals  which  may  be
required to close the transaction and to continue to operate the target firm’s business or products in a manner that is useful to us. We may not
successfully  evaluate  or  utilize  the  acquired  products,  services,  technology,  or  personnel,  or  accurately  forecast  the  financial  impact  of  an
acquisition  transaction,  including  accounting  charges.  We  may  have  to  pay  cash,  incur  debt,  or  issue  equity  securities  to  pay  for  any  such
acquisition, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance
any  such  acquisitions  could  result  in  dilution  to  our  stockholders,  which,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  acquisition,  may  be  significant.  The
incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede
our ability to manage our operations.

If we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand and reputation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could
be adversely affected.

Our brand and reputation are key assets and a competitive advantage. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand depends largely on
the  success  of  our  marketing  efforts,  ability  to  provide  consistent,  high-quality,  and  secure  products,  services,  features,  and  support,  and  our
ability  to  successfully  secure,  maintain,  and  defend  our  rights  to  use  the  “Coinbase”  mark  and  other  trademarks  important  to  our  brand.  We
believe that the importance of our brand will increase as competition further intensifies. Our brand and reputation could be harmed if we fail to
achieve  these  objectives  or  if  our  public  image  were  to  be  tarnished  by  negative  publicity,  unexpected  events,  or  actions  by  third  parties.
Unfavorable  publicity  regarding,  for  example,  our  product  changes,  product  quality,  litigation  or  regulatory  activity,  privacy  and  data  security
practices, terms of service, employment matters, the use of our products, services, or supported crypto assets for illicit or objectionable ends, the
actions  of  our  customers,  or  the  actions  of  other  companies  that  provide  similar  services  to  ours,  has  in  the  past,  and  could  in  the  future,
adversely affect our reputation. Moreover, to the extent that we acquire a company and maintain that acquired company’s separate brand, we
could experience brand dilution or fail to retain positive impressions of our own brand to the extent such impressions are instead attributed to the
acquired company’s brand. In addition, because we are a founder-led company, actions by, or unfavorable publicity about, Brian Armstrong, our
co-founder  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  may  adversely  impact  our  brand  and  reputation.  Such  negative  publicity  also  could  have  an  adverse
effect on the size

74

Table of Contents

and  engagement  of  our  customers  and  could  result  in  decreased  revenue,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and
financial condition.

Key business metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and change as our business evolves,
and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected by real or perceived inaccuracies in those
metrics or any changes in metrics we disclose.

We  regularly  review  our  key  business  metrics  to  evaluate  our  business,  measure  our  performance,  identify  trends  affecting  our  business,
and  make  strategic  decisions.  These  key  business  metrics  are  calculated  using  internal  company  data  and  have  not  been  validated  by  an
independent  third-party.  While  these  numbers  are  based  on  what  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  estimates  for  the  applicable  period  of
measurement at the time of reporting, there are inherent challenges in such measurements. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform,
our  key  business  metrics  calculations  may  be  inaccurate,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  identify  those  inaccuracies. Additionally,  we  may  in  the
future calculate certain key business metrics using third-party data. While we believe the third-party data we have used in the past or may use in
the future is reliable, we have not independently verified and may not in the future independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data
contained in such sources and there can be no assurance that such data is free of error. Any inaccuracy in the third-party data we use could
cause us to overstate or understate our key business metrics. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to
time  we  make  adjustments  to  improve  their  accuracy. Additionally,  our  MTUs  metric  is  measured  at  a  point  in  time  and  as  our  products  and
internal  processes  for  calculating  these  metrics  evolve  over  time,  a  previously  reported  number  could  fluctuate.  We  generally  will  not  update
previously disclosed key business metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are immaterial.

Our  key  business  metrics  may  also  be  impacted  by  compliance  or  fraud-related  bans,  technical  incidents,  or  false  or  spam  accounts  in
existence on our platform. We regularly deactivate fraudulent and spam accounts that violate our terms of service, and exclude these users from
the  calculation  of  our  key  business  metrics;  however,  we  may  not  succeed  in  identifying  and  removing  all  such  accounts  from  our  platform.
Additionally, users are not prohibited from having more than one account and our MTUs metric may overstate the number of unique customers
who have registered an account on our platform as one customer may register for, and use, multiple accounts with different email addresses,
phone numbers, or usernames. Furthermore, MTUs may overstate the number of unique consumers due to differences in product architecture or
user behavior, which may cause MTUs to fluctuate. For example, a user may currently have a Coinbase Wallet account that is unlinked to their
registered account on our platform, but then choose to link these accounts in the future as our product offerings evolve. To the extent that the
user had activity in both their Wallet and their registered account in the measurement period, what was previously captured as two unique MTUs
would now be counted as a single MTU. If MTUs or our other key business metrics provide us with incorrect or incomplete information about
users and their behavior, we may make inaccurate conclusions about our business.

We  may  change  our  key  business  metrics  from  time  to  time,  which  may  be  perceived  negatively.  Given  the  rapid  evolution  of  the  crypto
markets and our revenue sources, we regularly evaluate whether our key business metrics remain meaningful indicators of the performance of
our business. As a result of these evaluations, in the past we have decided to make changes, and in the future may make additional changes, to
our key business metrics, including eliminating or replacing existing metrics. Further if investors or the media perceive any changes to our key
business metrics disclosures negatively, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our platform may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams. If our
platform is used to further such illegal activities, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our  platform  may  be  exploited  to  facilitate  illegal  activity  such  as  fraud,  money  laundering,  gambling,  tax  evasion,  and  scams.  We  or  our
partners may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers, and it may be difficult or impossible for us to detect
and  avoid  such  transactions  in  certain  circumstances.  The  use  of  our  platform  for  illegal  or  improper  purposes  could  subject  us  to  claims,
individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, prosecutions, enforcement actions, inquiries, or requests that
could  result  in  liability  and  reputational  harm  for  us.  Moreover,  certain  activities  that  may  be  legal  in  one  jurisdiction  may  be  illegal  in  another
jurisdiction,  and  certain  activities  that  are  at  one  time  legal  may  in  the  future  be  deemed  illegal  in  the  same  jurisdiction. As  a  result,  there  is
significant  uncertainty  and  cost  associated  with  detecting  and  monitoring  transactions  for  compliance  with  local  laws.  In  the  event  that  a
customer is found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently violating the laws in any jurisdiction, we may be subject to governmental inquiries,
enforcement actions, prosecuted, or otherwise held secondarily liable for aiding or facilitating such activities. Changes in law have also increased
the penalties for money transmitters for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider increased or additional penalties from
time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against money transmitters, including
us, for involvement in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and
any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business.

Moreover, while fiat currencies can be used to facilitate illegal activities, crypto assets are relatively new and, in many jurisdictions, may be
lightly  regulated  or  largely  unregulated.  Many  types  of  crypto  assets  have  characteristics,  such  as  the  speed  with  which  digital  currency
transactions can be conducted, the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in
transactions across multiple jurisdictions, the irreversible nature of certain crypto asset transactions, and encryption technology that anonymizes
these transactions, that make crypto assets susceptible to use in illegal activity. U.S. federal and state and foreign regulatory authorities and law
enforcement  agencies,  such  as  the  Department  of  Justice,  SEC,  CFTC,  FTC,  or  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (“IRS”),  and  various  state
securities and financial regulators have taken and continue to take legal action against persons and entities alleged to be engaged in fraudulent
schemes or other illicit activity involving crypto assets. We also support crypto assets that incorporate privacy-enhancing features, and may from
time to time support additional crypto assets with similar functionalities. These privacy-enhancing crypto assets obscure the identities of sender
and  receiver,  and  may  prevent  law  enforcement  officials  from  tracing  the  source  of  funds  on  the  blockchain.  Facilitating  transactions  in  these
crypto assets may cause us to be at increased risk of liability arising out of anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations.

While  we  believe  that  our  risk  management  and  compliance  framework  is  designed  to  detect  significant  illicit  activities  conducted  by  our
potential  or  existing  customers,  we  cannot  ensure  that  we  will  be  able  to  detect  all  illegal  activity  on  our  platform.  Base,  an  open  source
permissionless L2 protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain developed by us, has been in the past, and may in the future, be a target for scam
tokens or other illegal activity. For example, in August 2023, a number of fraudulent tokens were identified and traded on Base blockchain. As we
continue to develop Base, and in light of this fraudulent activity, we continue to invest in improving our security processes, including through our
in-house blockchain monitoring capabilities, third-party tools for identifying malicious and out of pattern events, and the monitoring of contract
source code and bytecode on Base against a database of known scam code patterns. While to date, such illegal or fraudulent activity on Base
has not had a material impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows, future illegal activity could adversely affect
our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows and our efforts to identify and remedy such illegal or fraudulent activity may not
be successful. If our platform is used to further such illegal activities, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our
reputation, operating results, and financial condition.

Our  ability  to  comply  with  applicable  complex  and  evolving  laws,  regulations,  and  rules  is  largely  dependent  on  the  establishment,
maintenance,  and  scaling  of  our  compliance,  internal  audit,  and  reporting  systems  to  continuously  keep  pace  with  our  customer  activity  and
transaction  volume,  as  well  as  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  compliance  and  other  risk  management  personnel.  While  we  have
devoted significant resources to develop policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage our risks, and expect to continue to do so in
the  future,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  our  policies  and  procedures  are  and  will  always  be  effective  or  that  we  have  been  and  will  always  be
successful  in  monitoring  or  evaluating  the  risks  to  which  we  are  or  may  be  exposed  in  all  market  environments  or  against  all  types  of  risks,
including  unidentified  or  unanticipated  risks.  Our  risk  management  policies  and  procedures  rely  on  a  combination  of  technical  and  human
controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. Some of our methods for managing risk are discretionary by nature and are based
on  internally  developed  controls  and  observed  historical  market  behavior,  and  also  involve  reliance  on  standard  industry  practices.  These
methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than
historical fluctuations in the market. Further, as a result of the 2022 Events or similar market disruptions in the future, we may reevaluate our risk
management  policies  and  procedures. Accordingly,  in  the  future,  we  may  identify  gaps  in  such  policies  and  procedures  or  existing  gaps  may
become higher risk, and may require significant resources and management attention. Our risk management policies and procedures also may
not  adequately  prevent  losses  due  to  technical  errors  if  our  testing  and  quality  control  practices  are  not  effective  in  preventing  failures.  In
addition, we may elect to adjust our risk management policies and procedures to allow for an increase in risk tolerance, which could expose us
to the risk of greater losses.

Regulators  periodically  review  our  compliance  with  our  own  policies  and  procedures  and  with  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations.  We  have
received in the past and may from time to time receive additional examination reports citing violations of rules and regulations and inadequacies
in existing compliance programs, and requiring us to enhance certain practices with respect to our compliance program, including due diligence,
training,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  recordkeeping.  If  we  fail  to  comply  with  these,  or  do  not  adequately  remediate  certain  findings,  regulators
could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business, including, but not limited to, delaying, denying, withdrawing,
or conditioning approval of certain products and services. In addition, regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease
and  desist  orders,  prohibit  us  from  engaging  in  some  of  our  business  activities,  or  revoke  our  licenses.  We  face  significant  intervention  by
regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activities, and will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by
regulatory  authorities  in  the  future.  In  the  case  of  non-compliance  or  alleged  non-compliance,  we  could  be  subject  to  investigations  and
proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages which can be significant. Any of these
outcomes would adversely affect our reputation and brand and our business, operating results, and financial condition. Some of these outcomes
could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.

We hold certain investments in DeFi protocols and may suffer losses if they do not function as expected.

We hold investments in various DeFi protocols. These protocols achieve their investment purposes through self-executing smart contracts
that allow users to invest crypto assets in a pool from which other users can borrow without requiring an intermediate party to facilitate these
transactions.  These  investments  earn  interest  to  the  investor  based  on  the  rates  at  which  borrowers  repay  the  loan,  and  can  generally  be
withdrawn  with  no  restrictions.  However,  these  DeFi  protocols  are  subject  to  various  risks,  including  uncertain  regulatory  and  compliance
conditions in large markets such as the United States, the risk that the underlying smart contract is insecure, the risk that borrowers may default
and the investor will not be able to recover its investment, the risk that any underlying collateral may experience significant volatility, and the risk
of certain core developers with protocol administration rights can make unauthorized

77

Table of Contents

or harmful changes to the underlying smart contract. If any of these risks materialize, our investments in these DeFi protocols may be adversely
impacted.

We may suffer losses due to abrupt and erratic market movements.

The crypto asset market has been characterized by significant volatility and unexpected price movements, and has experienced significant
declines in the past. Certain crypto assets may become more volatile and less liquid in a very short period of time, which was the case following
the 2022 Events, resulting in market prices being subject to erratic and abrupt market movement, which could harm our business. For instance,
abrupt changes in volatility or market movement can lead to extreme pressures on our platform and infrastructure that can lead to inadvertent
suspension of services across parts of the platform or the entire platform. As a result, from time to time we experience outages. For example, in
2024,  we  experienced  approximately  14  outages,  with  an  average  outage  duration  of  58.6  minutes.  Outages  can  lead  to  increased  customer
service expense, can cause customer loss and reputational damage, result in inquiries and actions by regulators, and can lead to other damages
for which we may be responsible.

Risks Related to Crypto Assets

Due  to  unfamiliarity  and  some  negative  publicity  associated  with  crypto  asset  platforms,  confidence  or  interest  in  crypto  asset
platforms may decline.

Crypto  asset  platforms  are  relatively  new.  Many  of  our  competitors  are  unlicensed,  unregulated,  operate  without  supervision  by  any
governmental  authorities,  and  do  not  provide  the  public  with  significant  information  regarding  their  ownership  structure,  management  team,
corporate practices, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. As a result, customers and the general public may lose confidence or interest in
crypto asset platforms, including regulated platforms like ours.

Since  the  inception  of  the  cryptoeconomy,  numerous  crypto  asset  platforms  have  been  sued,  investigated,  or  shut  down  due  to  fraud,
manipulative practices, business failure, and security breaches. In many of these instances, customers of these platforms were not compensated
or made whole for their losses. Larger platforms like us are more appealing targets for hackers and malware, and may also be more likely to be
targets of regulatory enforcement actions. For example, in February 2014, Mt. Gox, the then largest crypto asset platform worldwide, filed for
bankruptcy protection in Japan after an estimated 700,000 Bitcoins were stolen from its wallets. In May 2019, Binance, one of the world’s largest
platforms, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $40 million, and in February 2021, Bitfinex settled a long-running legal dispute with
the  State  of  New  York  related  to  Bitfinex’s  alleged  misuse  of  over  $800  million  of  customer  assets.  The  2022  Events  resulted  in  a  loss  of
confidence in the broader cryptoeconomy, adverse reputational impact to crypto asset platforms, increased negative publicity surrounding crypto
more broadly, heightened scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers and a call for increased regulations of crypto assets and crypto asset platforms.

In addition, there have been reports that a significant amount of crypto asset trading volume on crypto asset platforms is fabricated and false
in nature, with a specific focus on unregulated platforms located outside the United States. Such reports may indicate that the market for crypto
asset platform activities is significantly smaller than otherwise understood.

Negative perception, a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the cryptoeconomy, and the closure or temporary shutdown of crypto
asset  platforms  due  to  fraud,  business  failure,  hackers  or  malware,  or  government  mandated  regulation,  and  associated  losses  suffered  by
customers may continue to reduce confidence or interest in the cryptoeconomy and result in greater volatility of the prices of assets, including
significant  depreciation  in  value.  Any  of  these  events  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  our  customers’  perception  of  us,
including decreased use of our platform and loss of customer demand for our products and services.

Depositing and withdrawing crypto assets into and from our platforms involve risks, which could result in loss of customer assets,
customer disputes and other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In  order  to  own,  transfer  and  use  a  crypto  asset  on  its  underlying  blockchain  network,  a  person  must  have  a  private  and  public  key  pair
associated with a network address, commonly referred to as a “wallet.” Each wallet is associated with a unique “public key” and “private key”
pair, each of which is a string of alphanumerical characters. To deposit crypto assets held by a customer onto our platforms, a customer must
“sign” a transaction that consists of the private key of the wallet from where the customer is transferring crypto assets, the public key of a wallet
that we control which we provide to the customer, and broadcast the deposit transaction onto the underlying blockchain network. Similarly, to
withdraw  crypto  assets  from  our  platforms,  the  customer  must  provide  us  with  the  public  key  of  the  wallet  that  the  crypto  assets  are  to  be
transferred  to,  and  we  would  be  required  to  “sign”  a  transaction  authorizing  the  transfer.  In  addition,  some  crypto  networks  require  additional
information to be provided in connection with any transfer of crypto assets to or from our platforms. A number of errors can occur in the process
of depositing or withdrawing crypto assets into or from our platforms, such as typos, mistakes, or the failure to include the information required
by the blockchain network. For instance, a user may incorrectly enter our wallet’s public key or the desired recipient’s public key when depositing
and withdrawing from our platforms, respectively. Alternatively, a user may transfer crypto assets to a wallet address that the user does not own,
control  or  hold  the  private  keys  to.  In  addition,  each  wallet  address  is  only  compatible  with  the  underlying  blockchain  network  on  which  it  is
created. For instance, a Bitcoin wallet address can only be used to send and receive Bitcoins. If any Ethereum or other crypto assets are sent to
a Bitcoin wallet address, or if any of the foregoing errors occur, all of the customer’s sent crypto assets will be permanently and irretrievably lost
with no means of recovery. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter similar incidents with our customers. Such incidents could
result in customer disputes, damage to our brand and reputation, legal claims against us, and financial liabilities, any of which could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Moreover, we hold customer assets one-to-one at all times and we have procedures to process redemptions and withdrawals expeditiously,
following  the  terms  of  the  applicable  user  agreements.  We  have  not  experienced  excessive  redemptions  or  withdrawals,  or  prolonged
suspended  redemptions  or  withdrawals,  of  crypto  assets  to  date.  However,  similar  to  traditional  financial  institutions,  we  may  experience
temporary  process-related  withdrawal  delays.  For  example,  we,  and  traditional  financial  institutions,  may  experience  such  delays  if  there  is  a
significant volume of withdrawal requests that is vastly beyond anticipated levels. This does not mean we cannot or will not satisfy withdrawals,
but this may mean a temporary delay in satisfying withdrawal requests, which we still expect to be satisfied within the withdrawal timelines set
forth in the applicable user agreements or otherwise communicated by us. To the extent we have process-related delays, even if brief or due to
blockchain  network  congestion  or  heightened  redemption  activity,  and  within  the  terms  of  an  applicable  user  agreement  or  otherwise
communicated by us, we may experience increased customer complaints and damage to our brand and reputation and face additional regulatory
scrutiny, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

A temporary or permanent blockchain “fork” to any supported crypto asset could adversely affect our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

Blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are open source. Any user can download the software, modify it, and then propose
that  Bitcoin,  Ethereum,  or  other  blockchain  protocols  users  and  miners  adopt  the  modification.  When  a  modification  is  introduced  and  a
substantial majority of users and miners consent to the modification, the change is implemented and the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain
protocol networks, as applicable, remain uninterrupted. However, if less than a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the proposed
modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a
“fork” (i.e., “split”) of the impacted blockchain protocol network and respective blockchain, with one prong running the pre-modified software and
the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the

79

Table of Contents

existence of two parallel versions of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other blockchain protocol network, as applicable, running simultaneously, but with
each split network’s crypto asset lacking interchangeability.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols have been subject to “forks” that resulted in the creation of new networks, including Bitcoin Cash ABC,
Bitcoin Cash SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum Classic, EthereumPOW, and others. Some of these forks have caused fragmentation
among platforms as to the correct naming convention for forked crypto assets. Due to the lack of a central registry or rulemaking body, no single
entity has the ability to dictate the nomenclature of forked crypto assets, causing disagreements and a lack of uniformity among platforms on the
nomenclature of forked crypto assets, and which results in further confusion to customers as to the nature of assets they hold on platforms. In
addition,  several  of  these  forks  were  contentious  and  as  a  result,  participants  in  certain  communities  may  harbor  ill  will  towards  other
communities. As a result, certain community members may take actions that adversely impact the use, adoption, and price of Bitcoin, Ethereum,
or any of their forked alternatives.

Furthermore, hard forks can lead to new security concerns. For instance, when the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks split in July
2016,  replay  attacks,  in  which  transactions  from  one  network  were  rebroadcast  on  the  other  network  to  achieve  “double-spending,”  plagued
platforms  that  traded  Ethereum  through  at  least  October  2016,  resulting  in  significant  losses  to  some  crypto  asset  platforms.  Similar  replay
attacks occurred in connection with the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash SV network split in November 2018. Another possible result of a hard fork
is an inherent decrease in the level of security due to the splitting of some mining power across networks, making it easier for a malicious actor
to exceed 50% of the mining power of that network, thereby making crypto assets that rely on proof-of-work more susceptible to attack, as has
occurred with Ethereum Classic.

We do not believe that we are required to support any fork or airdrop or provide the benefit of any forked or airdropped crypto asset to our
customers. However, we have in the past and may in the future continue to be subject to claims by customers arguing that they are entitled to
receive certain forked or airdropped crypto assets by virtue of crypto assets that they hold with us. If any customers succeed on a claim that they
are entitled to receive the benefits of a forked or airdropped crypto asset that we do not or are unable to support, we may be required to pay
significant damages, fines or other fees to compensate customers for their losses.

Future  forks  may  occur  at  any  time.  A  fork  can  lead  to  a  disruption  of  networks  and  our  information  technology  systems,  cybersecurity
attacks, replay attacks, or security weaknesses, any of which can further lead to temporary or even permanent loss of our and our customers’
assets. Such disruption and loss could cause us to be exposed to liability, even in circumstances where we have no intention of supporting an
asset compromised by a fork.

We currently support, and expect to continue to support, certain smart contract-based crypto assets. If the underlying smart contracts
for these crypto assets do not operate as expected, they could lose value and our business, operating results, and financial condition
could be adversely affected.

We currently support, and expect to continue to support, various crypto assets that represent units of value on smart contracts deployed on a
third-party blockchain. Smart contracts are programs that store and transfer value and execute automatically when certain conditions are met.
Since smart contracts typically cannot be stopped or reversed, vulnerabilities in their programming and design can have damaging effects. For
instance, in April 2018, a batch overflow bug was found in many Ethereum-based ERC20-compatible smart contract tokens that allowed hackers
to  create  a  large  number  of  smart  contract  tokens,  causing  multiple  crypto  asset  platforms  worldwide  to  shut  down  ERC20-compatible  token
trading.  Similarly,  in  March  2020,  a  design  flaw  in  the  MakerDAO  smart  contract  caused  forced  liquidations  of  crypto  assets  at  significantly
discounted  prices,  resulting  in  millions  of  dollars  of  losses  to  users  who  had  deposited  crypto  assets  into  the  smart  contract.  If  any  such
vulnerabilities or flaws come to fruition, smart contract-based crypto assets, including those held by our customers on our platforms, may suffer

80

Table of Contents

negative publicity, be exposed to security vulnerabilities, decline significantly in value, and lose liquidity over a short period of time.

In  some  cases,  smart  contracts  can  be  controlled  by  one  or  more  “admin  keys”  or  users  with  special  privileges,  or  “super  users.”  These
users have the ability to unilaterally make changes to the smart contract, enable or disable features on the smart contract, change how the smart
contract receives external inputs and data, and make other changes to the smart contract. For smart contracts that hold a pool of reserves, these
users  may  also  be  able  to  extract  funds  from  the  pool,  liquidate  assets  held  in  the  pool,  or  take  other  actions  that  decrease  the  value  of  the
assets held by the smart contract in reserves. Even for crypto assets that have adopted a decentralized governance mechanism, such as smart
contracts that are governed by the holders of a governance token, such governance tokens can be concentrated in the hands of a small group of
core community members, who would be able to make similar changes unilaterally to the smart contract. If any such super user or group of core
members unilaterally make adverse changes to a smart contract, the design, functionality, features and value of the smart contract, its related
crypto assets may be harmed. In addition, assets held by the smart contract in reserves may be stolen, misused, burnt, locked up or otherwise
become unusable and irrecoverable. These super users can also become targets of hackers and malicious attackers. If an attacker is able to
access or obtain the super user privileges of a smart contract, or if a smart contract’s super users or core community members take actions that
adversely affect the smart contract, our customers who hold and transact in the affected crypto assets may experience decreased functionality
and value of the applicable crypto assets, up to and including a total loss of the value of such crypto assets. Although we do not control these
smart contracts, any such events could cause customers to seek damages against us for their losses, result in reputational damage to us, or in
other ways adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

From time to time, we may encounter technical issues in connection with the integration of supported crypto assets and changes and
upgrades to their underlying networks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In order to support any supported crypto asset, a variety of front and back-end technical and development work is required to implement our
wallet, custody, trading, staking and other solutions for our customers, and to integrate such supported crypto asset with our existing technical
infrastructure. For certain crypto assets, a significant amount of development work is required and there is no guarantee that we will be able to
integrate successfully with any existing or future crypto asset. In addition, such integration may introduce software errors or weaknesses into our
platform,  including  our  existing  infrastructure.  Even  if  such  integration  is  initially  successful,  any  number  of  technical  changes,  software
upgrades,  soft  or  hard  forks,  cybersecurity  incidents,  or  other  changes  to  the  underlying  blockchain  network  may  occur  from  time  to  time,
causing  incompatibility,  technical  issues,  disruptions,  or  security  weaknesses  to  our  platform.  If  we  are  unable  to  identify,  troubleshoot  and
resolve any such issues successfully, we may no longer be able to support such crypto asset, our customers’ assets may be frozen or lost, the
security of our hot, warm, or cold wallets may be compromised, and our platform and technical infrastructure may be affected, all of which could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

If miners or validators of any supported crypto asset demand high transaction fees, our business, operating results, and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

We  charge  blockchain  transaction  fees  when  a  customer  sends  certain  crypto  assets  from  their  Coinbase  account  to  a  non-Coinbase
account. We estimate the blockchain transaction fee based on the cost that we will incur to process the withdrawal transaction on the underlying
blockchain network. In addition, we also pay blockchain transaction fees when we move crypto assets for various operational purposes, such as
when we transfer crypto assets between our hot and cold wallets, for which we do not charge our customers. However, blockchain transaction
fees  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be  unpredictable.  If  the  block  rewards  for  miners  on  any  blockchain  network  are  not  sufficiently  high  to
incentivize miners, miners may demand higher transaction fees, or collude to reject low transaction fees

81

Table of Contents

and force users to pay higher fees. Although we generally attempt to pass blockchain transaction fees relating to customer withdrawals through
to  our  customers,  we  have  in  the  past  incurred,  and  expect  to  incur  from  time  to  time,  losses  associated  with  the  payment  of  blockchain
transaction  fees  in  excess  of  what  we  charge  our  customers,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition.

Future developments regarding the treatment of crypto assets for U.S. and foreign tax purposes could adversely affect our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Due to the new and evolving nature of crypto assets and the absence of comprehensive legal and tax guidance with respect to crypto asset
products and transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. and foreign tax treatment of transactions involving crypto assets, such as the
purchase and sale of crypto assets on our platform, as well as the provision of blockchain rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards
products,  are  uncertain,  and  it  is  unclear  whether,  when  and  what  guidance  may  be  issued  in  the  future  on  the  treatment  of  crypto  asset
transactions for U.S. and foreign tax purposes.

In  2014,  the  IRS  released  Notice  2014-21,  discussing  certain  aspects  of  “virtual  currency”  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes  and,  in
particular, stating that such virtual currency (i) is “property,” (ii) is not “currency” for purposes of the rules relating to foreign currency gain or loss,
and (iii) may be held as a capital asset. From time to time, the IRS has released other guidance relating to the tax treatment of virtual currency or
crypto  assets  reflecting  the  IRS’s  position  on  certain  issues.  The  IRS  has  not  addressed  many  other  significant  aspects  of  the  U.S.  federal
income tax treatment of crypto assets and related transactions.

There  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  the  timing,  character,  and  amount  of  income  inclusions  for  various  crypto  asset
transactions including, but not limited to lending and borrowing crypto assets, staking, and other crypto asset incentives and products that we
offer. Although we believe our treatment of crypto asset transactions for federal income tax purposes is consistent with existing positions from
the IRS and/or existing U.S. federal income tax principles, because of the rapidly evolving nature of crypto asset innovations and the increasing
variety and complexity of crypto asset transactions and products, it is possible the IRS and various U.S. states may disagree with our treatment
of  certain  crypto  asset  offerings  for  U.S.  tax  purposes,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  customers  and  the  vitality  of  our  business.  Similar
uncertainties  exist  in  the  foreign  markets  in  which  we  operate  with  respect  to  direct  and  indirect  taxes,  and  these  uncertainties  and  potential
adverse  interpretations  of  tax  law  could  impact  the  amount  of  tax  we  and  our  non-U.S.  customers  are  required  to  pay,  and  the  vitality  of  our
platforms outside of the United States.

There can be no assurance that the IRS, U.S. state revenue agencies, or other foreign tax authorities, will not alter their respective positions
with  respect  to  crypto  assets  in  the  future  or  that  a  court  would  uphold  the  treatment  set  forth  in  existing  positions.  It  also  is  unclear  what
additional tax authority positions, regulations, or legislation may be issued in the future on the treatment of existing crypto asset transactions and
future  crypto  asset  innovations  under  U.S.  federal,  U.S.  state,  or  foreign  tax  law.  Any  such  developments  could  result  in  adverse  tax
consequences  for  holders  of  crypto  assets  and  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  value  of  crypto  assets  and  the  broader  crypto  assets
markets.  Future  technological  and  operational  developments  that  may  arise  with  respect  to  crypto  assets  may  increase  the  uncertainty  with
respect to the treatment of crypto assets for U.S. and foreign tax purposes. The uncertainty regarding tax treatment of crypto asset transactions
impacts our customers, and could impact our business, both domestically and abroad.

Our tax information reporting obligations with respect to crypto transactions may be subject to further scrutiny in light of changes
made to the U.S. and global broker reporting regime for tax reporting.

In  November  2021,  the  U.S.  Congress  passed  the  Infrastructure  Investment  and  Jobs  Act  (the  “IIJA”),  providing  that  brokers  would  be

responsible for reporting to the IRS the transactions of their customers in

82

Table of Contents

digital  assets,  including  transfers  to  other  exchanges  or  to  digital  asset  wallets  not  connected  to  any  exchange.  On  June  28,  2024,  the  U.S.
Treasury  Department  and  the  IRS  released  final  regulations  and  issued  other  administrative  guidance  on  tax  information  reporting  for  digital
assets (collectively, the “Final Regulations”) that will be applicable, in certain cases starting January 1, 2025. The Final Regulations introduced
new rules related to our tax reporting and withholding obligations on our customer transactions.

Although  we  believe  we  are  compliant  with  U.S.  tax  reporting  and  withholding  requirements  with  respect  to  our  customers’  crypto  asset
transactions, our compliance with the Final Regulations, including but not limited to U.S. onboarding requirements through Forms W-9 and W-8,
backup withholding, non-resident alien withholding, and Form 1099 and Form 1042-S reporting obligations, may be subject to scrutiny and may
be challenged. There is a risk that we may not have proper processes and procedures necessary to comply with the Final Regulations, may not
be  able  to  interpret  the  IIJA,  the  Final  Regulations,  or  the  administrative  guidance  correctly,  or  may  not  be  able  to  build  systems  within  the
required timelines to ensure compliance for certain customers or transactions. If the IRS determines that we are not in compliance with our tax
reporting or withholding obligations on customer transactions, significant taxes and penalties may be imposed, which could adversely affect our
financial position. The Final Regulations will require us to invest substantially in new compliance processes and procedures, which also could
adversely affect our financial position. Further, the IRS may issue additional guidance in the future with respect to tax reporting and withholding
obligations, which could impose additional burdens on us and result in significant taxes and penalties that could adversely affect our financial
position.

Similarly,  new  rules  for  reporting  crypto  assets  under  the  global  “common  reporting  standard”  (CRS)  as  well  as  under  the  “crypto-asset
reporting  framework”  (CARF)  will  be  implemented  on  our  international  operations,  creating  new  obligations  and  a  need  to  invest  in  new
onboarding and reporting infrastructure. Such rules are under discussion by the member and observer states of the “Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development” and by the European Commission on behalf of the member states of the European Union. These new rules may
give  rise  to  potential  liabilities  or  disclosure  requirements  for  prior  customer  arrangements  and  new  rules  that  affect  how  we  onboard  our
customers and report their transactions to taxing authorities. Additionally, the European Union has issued a directive, commonly referred to as
“CESOP”  (the  Central  Electronic  System  of  Payment  information),  which  requires  payment  service  providers  in  the  European  Union  to  report
cross-border fiat transactions to taxing authorities on a quarterly basis. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with the above or any
other tax and financial regulations that apply to our operations could harm our business and adversely affect our financial position.

The nature of our business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules, and there is limited guidance from
accounting standard setting bodies on certain topics. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes, our operating
results could fluctuate.

The  accounting  rules  and  regulations  that  we  must  comply  with  are  complex  and  subject  to  interpretation  by  the  Financial  Accounting
Standards Board (the “FASB”), the SEC, and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. Recent
actions and public comments from the FASB and the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls and many
companies’  accounting  policies  are  being  subjected  to  heightened  scrutiny  by  regulators  and  the  public.  Further,  there  has  been  limited
precedent for the financial accounting of crypto assets and related valuation and revenue recognition. Moreover, a change in these principles or
interpretations  could  have  a  significant  effect  on  our  reported  financial  results,  and  may  even  affect  the  reporting  of  transactions  completed
before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, in December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2023-08,  Intangibles—Goodwill  and  Other—Crypto Assets  (ASU  2023-08): Accounting  for  and  Disclosure  of  Crypto Assets  (“ASU  2023-08”),
which represents a significant change in how entities that hold crypto assets will account for certain of those holdings. Previously, crypto assets
held were accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which required us to measure crypto assets at cost less impairment.
Effective as of January 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-08, which requires us to measure crypto assets held at fair value

83

Table of Contents

at  each  reporting  date,  with  fair  value  gains  and  losses  recognized  through  Net  income  (loss).  Fair  value  gains  and  losses  can  increase  the
volatility  of  our  net  income,  especially  if  the  underlying  crypto  asset  market  is  volatile. Additionally,  on  March  31,  2022,  the  staff  of  the  SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 121 (“SAB 121”), which represented a significant change regarding how a company safeguarding
crypto assets held for its platform users reports such crypto assets on its balance sheet and required retrospective application as of January 1,
2022.  In  January  2025,  the  staff  of  the  SEC  issued  SAB  No.  122  (“SAB  122”),  which  rescinds  the  previously-issued  interpretive  guidance
included within SAB 121. We have adopted SAB 122 as of December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis.

Uncertainties in or changes to regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the need to change our accounting methods and
may  retroactively  affect  previously  reported  results  and  impair  our  ability  to  provide  timely  and  accurate  financial  information,  which  could
adversely affect our financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Privacy Matters

The cryptoeconomy is novel. As a result, policymakers are just beginning to consider what a regulatory regime for crypto would look
like and the elements that would serve as the foundation for such a regime. This less developed consideration of crypto may harm our
ability to effectively react to proposed legislation and regulation of crypto assets or crypto asset platforms adverse to our business.

As  crypto  assets  have  grown  in  both  popularity  and  market  size,  various  U.S.  federal,  state,  and  local  and  foreign  governmental
organizations,  consumer  agencies  and  public  advocacy  groups  have  been  examining  the  operations  of  crypto  networks,  users  and  platforms,
with  a  focus  on  how  crypto  assets  can  be  used  to  launder  the  proceeds  of  illegal  activities,  fund  criminal  or  terrorist  enterprises,  and
simultaneously how to ensure the safety and soundness of platforms and other service providers that hold crypto assets for users. Many of these
entities  have  called  for  heightened  regulatory  oversight,  and  have  issued  consumer  advisories  describing  the  risks  posed  by  crypto  assets  to
users and investors.

Competitors,  including  traditional  financial  services,  have  spent  years  cultivating  professional  relationships  with  relevant  policymakers  on
behalf  of  their  industry  so  that  those  policymakers  may  understand  that  industry,  the  current  legal  landscape  affecting  that  industry,  and  the
specific policy proposals that could be implemented in order to responsibly develop that industry. The lobbyists working for these competitors
have similarly spent years developing and working to implement strategies to advance these industries. Members of the cryptoeconomy have
started to engage policymakers directly and with the help of external advisors and lobbyists. For example, in order to advance our mission, in
February  2022  we  launched  our  Coinbase  Innovation  Political Action  Committee  to  support  crypto-forward  political  candidates  and  initiatives.
Further, in December 2023, we together with a number of other crypto and blockchain market participants supported the launch of the Fairshake
Political  Action  Committee  to  support  political  candidates  in  the  2024  U.S.  presidential  and  congressional  elections  who  support  crypto  and
blockchain  innovation  and  responsible  regulation.  However,  these  efforts  to  educate  policymakers  and  advocate  for  sensible  regulation  are
nascent compared to more established industries, and may be perceived unfavorably by investors and the public and have an adverse impact on
our  brand  and  reputation.  As  a  result,  new  laws  and  regulations  may  be  proposed  and  adopted  in  the  United  States  and  internationally,  or
existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that harm the cryptoeconomy or crypto asset platforms, which could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets may not contain sufficient amounts or types of regulatory capital to meet the changing
requirements  of  our  various  regulators  worldwide,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition.

We are required to possess sufficient financial soundness and strength to adequately support our regulated subsidiaries. We may from time
to time incur indebtedness and other obligations which could make it more difficult to meet these capitalization requirements or any additional
regulatory  requirements.  In  addition,  although  we  are  not  a  bank  holding  company  for  purposes  of  United  States  law  or  the  law  of  any  other
jurisdiction,  as  a  global  provider  of  financial  services  and  in  light  of  the  changing  regulatory  environment  in  various  jurisdictions,  we  could
become subject to new capital requirements introduced or imposed by the United States and international regulators. Any change or increase in
these regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As  a  financial  institution  licensed  to,  among  other  things,  engage  in  money  transmission  in  the  United  States,  to  conduct  virtual  currency
business  activity  in  New  York,  and  issue  electronic  money  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  European  Union,  we  are  subject  to  strict  rules
governing how we manage and hold customer fiat currency and crypto assets. We maintain complex treasury operations to manage and move
customer  fiat  currency  and  crypto  assets  across  our  platforms  and  to  comply  with  regulatory  requirements.  However,  it  is  possible  we  may
experience errors in fiat currency and crypto asset handling, accounting, and regulatory reporting that lead us to be out of compliance with these
requirements. In addition, regulators may increase the amount of fiat currency reserves that we are required to maintain for our operations, as
has happened in the past, which may lead to sanctions, penalties, changes to our business operations, or the revocation of licenses. Frequent
launch of new products and services, margin trading, lending functions, and the addition of new payment rails increase these risks.

Many  of  the  crypto  assets  in  which  we  facilitate  trading  are  subject  to  regulatory  authority  by  the  CFTC.  Any  fraudulent  or
manipulative  activity  in  a  crypto  asset  occurring  on  our  platform  could  subject  us  to  increased  regulatory  scrutiny,  regulatory
enforcement, and litigation.

The CFTC has stated and judicial decisions involving CFTC enforcement actions have confirmed that at least some crypto assets, including
Bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and stablecoins, such as USDC, USDT and BUSD, fall within the definition of a “commodity” under the U.S. Commodities
Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, the CFTC has general enforcement authority to police against manipulation and fraud in at least
some  spot  crypto  asset  markets.  From  time  to  time,  manipulation,  fraud,  and  other  forms  of  improper  trading  by  market  participants  have
resulted  in,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in,  CFTC  investigations,  inquiries,  enforcement  action,  and  similar  actions  by  other  regulators,
government  agencies,  and  civil  litigation.  Such  investigations,  inquiries,  enforcement  actions,  and  litigation  may  cause  us  to  incur  substantial
costs and could result in negative publicity.

Certain  transactions  in  crypto  assets  may  constitute  “retail  commodity  transactions”  subject  to  regulation  by  the  CFTC  as  futures
contracts.  If  crypto  asset  transactions  we  facilitate  are  deemed  to  be  such  retail  commodity  transactions,  we  would  be  subject  to
additional regulatory requirements, licenses and approvals, and potentially face regulatory enforcement, civil liability, and significant
increased compliance and operational costs.

Any  transaction  in  a  commodity,  including  a  crypto  asset,  entered  into  with  or  offered  to  retail  investors  using  leverage,  margin,  or  other
financing arrangements (a “retail commodity transaction”) is subject to CFTC regulation as a futures contract unless such transaction results in
actual delivery within 28 days. The meaning of “actual delivery” has been the subject of commentary and litigation, and the CFTC has adopted
interpretive guidance addressing the “actual delivery” of a crypto asset. To the extent that crypto asset transactions that we facilitate or facilitated
are deemed retail commodity transactions, including pursuant to current or subsequent rulemaking or guidance by the CFTC, we may be subject
to additional regulatory requirements and oversight, and we could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions if we do not or did not at a
relevant  time  possess  appropriate  registrations.  The  CFTC  has  previously  brought  enforcement  actions  against  entities  engaged  in  retail
commodity transactions without

85

Table of Contents

appropriate registrations, as well as recent enforcement settled orders against developers of decentralized platforms.

Particular  crypto  assets  or  transactions  therein  could  be  deemed  “commodity  interests”  (e.g.,  futures,  options,  swaps)  or  security-
based  swaps  subject  to  regulation  by  the  CFTC  or  SEC,  respectively.  If  a  crypto  asset  that  we  facilitate  trading  in  is  deemed  a
commodity interest or a security-based swap, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, registrations and approvals,
and potentially face regulatory enforcement, civil liability, and significant increased compliance and operational costs.

Commodity  interests,  as  such  term  is  defined  by  the  CEA  and  CFTC  rules  and  regulations,  are  subject  to  more  extensive  supervisory
oversight  by  the  CFTC,  including  registrations  of  entities  engaged  in,  and  platforms  offering,  commodity  interest  transactions.  This  CFTC
authority extends to crypto asset futures contracts and swaps, including transactions that are based on current and future prices of crypto assets
and indices of crypto assets. To the extent that a crypto asset in which we facilitate or facilitated trading or transactions in a crypto asset which
we  facilitate  or  facilitated  are  deemed  to  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  commodity  interest,  including  pursuant  to  subsequent  rulemaking  or
guidance by the CFTC, we may be subject to additional regulatory requirements and oversight and could be subject to judicial or administrative
sanctions  if  we  do  not  or  did  not  at  a  relevant  time  possess  appropriate  registrations  as  an  exchange  (for  example,  as  a  designated  contract
market for trading futures or options on futures, or as a swaps execution facility for trading swaps) or as a registered intermediary (for example,
as  a  futures  commission  merchant  or  introducing  broker).  Such  actions  could  result  in  injunctions,  cease  and  desist  orders,  as  well  as  civil
monetary  penalties,  fines,  and  disgorgement,  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  The  CFTC  has  previously  brought  enforcement  actions  against
entities engaged in crypto asset activities for failure to obtain appropriate exchange, execution facility and intermediary registrations.

Furthermore, the CFTC and the SEC have jointly adopted regulations defining “security-based swaps,” which include swaps based on single
securities and narrow-based indices of securities. If a crypto asset is deemed to be a security, certain transactions referencing that crypto asset
could  constitute  a  security-based  swap. A  crypto  asset  or  transaction  therein  that  is  based  on  or  references  a  security  or  index  of  securities,
whether or not such securities are themselves crypto assets, could also constitute a security-based swap. To the extent that a crypto asset in
which we facilitate or have facilitated trading or transactions in a crypto asset which we facilitate or have facilitated are deemed to fall within the
definition  of  a  security-based  swap,  including  pursuant  to  subsequent  rulemaking  or  guidance  by  the  CFTC  or  SEC,  we  may  be  subject  to
additional regulatory requirements and oversight by the SEC and could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions if we do not or did not a
relevant time possess appropriate registrations as an exchange (for example, as a security-based swaps execution facility) or as a registered
intermediary (for example, as a security-based swap dealer or broker-dealer). This could result in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as
civil monetary penalties, fines, and disgorgement, as well as reputational harm.

We obtain and process a large amount of sensitive customer data. Any real or perceived improper use of, disclosure of, or access to
such data could harm our reputation, as well as adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We  obtain  and  process  large  amounts  of  sensitive  data,  including  personal  data  related  to  our  customers  and  their  transactions,  such  as
their  names,  addresses,  social  security  numbers,  visa  information,  copies  of  government-issued  identification,  facial  recognition  data  (from
scanning of photographs for identity verification), trading data, tax identification, and bank account information. We face risks, including to our
reputation, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business continues to expand, including through our
acquisition of, and investment in, other companies and technologies. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations governing privacy,
data protection, and e-commerce transactions require us to safeguard our customers’, employees’, and service providers’ personal data.

We have administrative, technical, and physical security measures and controls in place and maintain a robust information security program.
However,  our  security  measures,  those  of  our  vendors  or  service  providers,  or  the  security  measures  of  companies  we  acquire,  may  be
inadequate or breached as a result of third-party action, employee or service provider error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks,
system error, trickery, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or otherwise,
and,  as  a  result,  someone  may  be  able  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to  sensitive  information,  including  personal  data,  on  our  systems.  We
could be the target of a cybersecurity incident, which could result in harm to our reputation and financial losses. Additionally, our customers have
been and could be targeted in cybersecurity incidents like an account takeover, which could result in harm to our reputation and financial losses.
For  example,  in  2021,  third  parties  independently  obtained  login  credentials  and  personal  data  for  at  least  6,000  customers  and  used  those
credentials to exploit a vulnerability that previously existed in the account recovery process. We reimbursed impacted customers approximately
$25.1  million. Additionally,  privacy  and  data  protection  laws  are  evolving,  and  these  laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  in  a  manner  that  is
inconsistent with our data handling safeguards and practices that could result in fines, lawsuits, and other penalties, and significant changes to
our or our third-party partners’ business practices and products and service offerings.

Our future success depends on the reliability and security of our platform. To the extent that the measures we, any companies we acquire, or
our third-party service providers, vendors, or business partners have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, or to the extent we discover a
security  breach  suffered  by  a  company  we  acquire  following  the  closing  of  such  acquisition,  we  may  become  subject  to  litigation,  breach
notification  obligations,  or  regulatory  or  administrative  sanctions,  which  could  result  in  significant  fines,  penalties,  damages,  harm  to  our
reputation, or loss of customers. If our own confidential business information or sensitive customer information were improperly disclosed, our
business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected. Additionally,  a  party  who  circumvents  our  security  measures
could,  among  other  effects,  appropriate  customer  information  or  other  proprietary  data,  cause  interruptions  in  our  operations,  or  expose
customers to hacks, viruses, and other disruptions.

Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our customer data,
we may also have obligations to notify customers and regulators about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as
a  subscription  to  credit  monitoring  services,  pay  significant  fines  to  one  or  more  regulators,  or  pay  compensation  in  connection  with  a  class-
action settlement. Breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, the
SEC  has  adopted  rules  for  mandatory  disclosure  of  material  cybersecurity  incidents  suffered  by  public  companies,  as  well  as  cybersecurity
governance  and  risk  management.  Complying  with  these  obligations  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs  and  could  increase  negative
publicity surrounding any incident that compromises customer data. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws may also
subject  us  to  enforcement  action  or  litigation,  any  of  which  could  harm  our  business.  Additionally,  the  financial  exposure  from  the  events
referenced above could either not be insured against or not be fully covered through any insurance that we may maintain, and there can be no
assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or
damages as a result of the events referenced above. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, and
financial condition.

Furthermore,  we  may  be  required  to  disclose  personal  data  pursuant  to  demands  from  individuals,  regulators,  government  agencies,  and
law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions with conflicting privacy and security laws, which could result in a breach of privacy and data
protection  policies,  notices,  laws,  rules,  court  orders,  and  regulations.  Additionally,  changes  in  the  laws  and  regulations  that  govern  our
collection,  use,  and  disclosure  of  customer  data  could  impose  additional  requirements  with  respect  to  the  retention  and  security  of  customer
data, could limit our marketing activities, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are subject to laws, regulations, and industry requirements related to data privacy, data protection and information security, and
user  protection  across  different  markets  where  we  conduct  our  business,  including  in  the  United  States,  European  Economic Area
(the “EEA”), and Asia-Pacific region, and industry requirements and such laws, regulations, and industry requirements are constantly
evolving  and  changing.  Any  actual  or  perceived  failure  to  comply  with  such  laws,  regulations,  and  industry  requirements,  or  our
privacy policies, could harm our business.

Various local, state, federal, and international laws, directives, and regulations apply to our collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure,
transfer,  and  processing  of  personal  data. These  data  protection  and  privacy  laws  and  regulations  are  subject  to  uncertainty  and  continue  to
evolve in ways that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. These laws have a substantial impact on our
operations both outside and in the United States, either directly or as a data processor and handler for various offshore entities.

In the United States, state and federal lawmakers and regulatory authorities have increased their attention on the collection and use of user
data and various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Gramm
Leach  Bliley Act  (“GLBA”)  and  state  laws  relating  to  privacy  and  data  security.  GLBA  requires  financial  institutions  to  explain  their  information
sharing  practices  to  their  customers  and  to  safeguard  sensitive  data. Additionally,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  and  many  state  attorneys
general  are  interpreting  federal  and  state  consumer  protection  laws  as  imposing  standards  for  the  online  collection,  use,  dissemination,  and
security of data. For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”).

The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide disclosures to individuals in California, and affords such individuals
new privacy rights such as the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and expanded rights to access and require deletion of
their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information
is collected, used, and shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for security breaches that
may increase security breach litigation.

In addition, other U.S. states have proposed or enacted laws that contain obligations similar to the CCPA that have taken effect or will take
effect in coming years. We cannot fully predict the impact of recently proposed or enacted laws or regulations on our business or operations, but
compliance  may  require  us  to  modify  our  data  processing  practices  and  policies  incurring  costs  and  expense.  Further,  to  the  extent  multiple
state-level  laws  are  introduced  with  inconsistent  or  conflicting  standards,  it  may  require  costly  and  difficult  efforts  to  achieve  compliance  with
such  laws.  Our  failure  or  perceived  failure  to  comply  with  state  privacy  laws  or  regulations  passed  in  the  future  could  adversely  affect  our
business, including how we use personal information, operating results, and financial condition.

Additionally,  many  foreign  countries  and  governmental  bodies,  including  Australia,  Brazil,  Kenya,  the  European  Union,  India,  Japan,
Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business,
have laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, processing, storage, and deletion of personal data obtained from their residents or by
businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws
and  regulations  may  require  companies  to  implement  new  privacy  and  security  policies,  permit  individuals  to  access,  correct,  and  delete
personal data stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal data, require that certain
types of data be retained on local servers within these jurisdictions, and, in some cases, obtain individuals’ affirmative opt-in consent to collect
and use personal data for certain purposes.

We  are  subject  to  both  the  European  Union’s  and  the  United  Kingdom’s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (collectively,  the  “GDPR”),
which imposes stringent privacy and data protection requirements, and could increase the risk of non-compliance and the costs of providing our
products and services in a

88

Table of Contents

compliant manner. A breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, fines and sanctions, orders to cease or
change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). For example, if regulators assert that
we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to €20 million in the European Union (£17.5 million in the U.K.) or 4%
of our worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type
litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated
costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm.

The GDPR and Swiss data protection laws impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U., U.K., or Switzerland to a “third
country,”  including  the  United  States,  unless  particular  compliance  mechanisms  are  implemented.  The  mechanisms  that  we  and  many  other
companies  rely  upon  for  such  data  transfers  (for  example,  standard  contractual  clauses  or  the  E.U.-U.S.  and  Swiss-U.S.  Data  Privacy
Framework (“DPF”) and the U.K. extension to the DPF) are the subject of legal challenge, regulatory interpretation, and judicial decisions. In the
E.U. and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of doing
business in those regions.

While we maintain E.U.-U.S., Swiss-U.S. and U.K.-U.S. DPF certification, we still rely on the standard contractual clauses for intercompany
data  transfers  from  the  European  Union,  Switzerland,  and  the  U.K.  to  the  United  States. As  supervisory  authorities  continue  to  issue  further
guidance on personal data, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory investigations or fines, and if we are otherwise unable to
transfer  personal  data  between  and  among  countries  and  regions  in  which  we  operate,  it  could  affect  the  manner  in  which  we  provide  our
services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations and could adversely affect our financial results.

We are also subject to evolving E.U. privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. In the European Union, regulators are increasingly focusing
on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and an E.U. regulation known as the ePrivacy Regulation will
significantly increase fines for non-compliance once in effect. In the European Union, informed consent, including a prohibition on pre-checked
consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents for each cookie, is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a
user’s  device  and  for  direct  electronic  marketing.  As  regulators  start  to  enforce  the  strict  approach  in  recent  guidance,  this  could  lead  to
substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology
personnel, negatively impact our efforts to understand users, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities.

There is a risk that as we expand, we may assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. Additionally, there are
potentially inconsistent world-wide government regulations pertaining to data protection and privacy. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable
laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings, or
platform could fail, or be alleged to fail to meet applicable requirements. For instance, the overall regulatory framework governing the application
of  privacy  laws  to  blockchain  technology  is  still  highly  undeveloped  and  likely  to  evolve.  Further  there  are  also  changes  in  the  regulatory
landscape relating to new and evolving technologies. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable
laws or regulations and to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of
failure has occurred, even if unfounded, could subject us to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations,
severe  criminal,  or  civil  sanctions,  damage  our  reputation,  or  result  in  fines  or  proceedings  by  governmental  agencies  and  private  claims  and
litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Issues  relating  to  the  development  and  use  of  AI  in  our  business  could  result  in  reputational  harm,  competitive  harm,  and  legal
liability, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We currently leverage internally developed and third-party developed AI into certain aspects of our business and we anticipate that AI will
become increasingly important to our operations in the future. Our competitors and other third parties may incorporate AI into their businesses or
offerings  more  quickly  or  more  successfully  than  us,  which  could  impair  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  and  adversely  affect  our  business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Our  use  of AI  may  result  in  new  or  expanded  risks  and  liabilities,  including  due  to  enhanced  governmental  or  regulatory  regulation  and
scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our
reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition. Evolving rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us
and our third-party developers to incur significant costs to modify, maintain, or align our business practices, services, and solutions to comply
with rules and regulations, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

There can be no assurance that the use of AI and machine learning solutions and features will enhance our products or services, produce
the  intended  results,  or  be  beneficial  to  our  business,  including  our  efficiency. AI  machine  learning  systems  are  complex  and  may  be  flawed,
insufficient,  reflect  unwanted  forms  of  bias,  or  contain  errors  or  inadequacies  that  are  not  easily  detectable,  or  may  cause  unintentional  or
unexpected  outputs  that  are  incorrect,  do  not  match  our  business  goals,  do  not  comply  with  our  policies  or  those  of  our  regulators,  or  are
otherwise are inconsistent with our brand. If the output that the AI applications we use to produce such output is, or is alleged to be, inaccurate,
deficient, or biased, our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Third Parties

Our current and future services are dependent on payment networks and acquiring processors, and any changes to their rules or
practices could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We rely on financial institutions and other payment processors to process customers’ payments in connection with the purchase of crypto
assets  on  our  platform  and  we  pay  these  providers  fees  for  their  services.  From  time  to  time,  payment  networks  have  increased,  and  may
increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that use their networks. Payment networks have
imposed, and may impose in the future, special fees on the purchase of crypto assets, including on our platform, which could negatively impact
us  and  significantly  increase  our  costs.  Our  payment  card  processors  may  have  the  right  to  pass  any  increases  in  interchange  fees  and
assessments on to us, and may impose additional use charges which would increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We
could attempt to pass these increases along to our customers, but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors that may
not pass along the increases, thereby reducing our revenue and earnings. If competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees
to our customers in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases, thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our
earnings.

We  may  also  be  directly  or  indirectly  liable  to  the  payment  networks  for  rule  violations.  Payment  networks  set  and  interpret  their  network
operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations
are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and
adversely  affect  our  business. The  payment  networks  could  adopt  new  operating  rules  or  interpret  or  reinterpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our
processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give customers the
option of using cards to fund their purchases or the choice of currency in which they would like their card

90

Table of Contents

to be charged. If we are unable to accept cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could
be adversely affected.

We depend on major mobile operating systems and third-party platforms for the distribution of certain products. If Google Play, the
Apple App Store, or other platforms prevent customers from downloading our apps, our ability to grow may be hindered and our
business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We rely upon third-party platforms for the distribution of certain products and services. Our Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet apps are provided
as free applications through both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and are also accessible via mobile and traditional websites.
The  Google  Play  Store  and Apple App  Store  are  global  application  distribution  platforms  and  the  main  distribution  channels  for  our  apps. As
such, the promotion, distribution, and operation of our apps are subject to the respective platforms’ terms and policies for application developers,
which are very broad and subject to frequent changes and re-interpretation. Further, these distribution platforms often contain restrictions related
to crypto assets that are uncertain, broadly construed, and can limit the nature and scope of services that can be offered. For example, Apple
App Store’s restrictions related to crypto assets have disrupted the proposed launch of many features within the Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet
apps, including NFT transfer services and access to decentralized applications. If our products are found to be in violation of any such terms and
conditions,  we  may  no  longer  be  able  to  offer  our  products  through  such  third-party  platforms.  There  can  be  no  guarantee  that  third-party
platforms will continue to support our product offerings, or that customers will be able to continue to use our products. For example, in November
2013, our iOS app was temporarily removed by Apple from the Apple App Store. In December 2019, we were similarly instructed by Apple to
remove certain features relating to decentralized applications from our application to comply with the Apple App Store’s policies. Any changes,
bugs, technical or regulatory issues with third-party platforms, our relationships with mobile manufacturers and carriers, or changes to their terms
of  service  or  policies  could  degrade  our  products’  functionalities,  reduce  or  eliminate  our  ability  to  distribute  our  products,  give  preferential
treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver high quality offerings, or impose fees or other charges, any of which could affect our
product usage and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

Our  business  depends  in  large  part  on  our  proprietary  technology  and  our  brand.  We  rely  on,  and  expect  to  continue  to  rely  on,  a
combination of trademark, trade dress, patents, domain name, copyright, and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality and license agreements
with our employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, to establish and protect our brand and other
intellectual  property  rights.  However,  our  efforts  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights  may  not  be  sufficient  or  effective.  Our  proprietary
technology  and  trade  secrets  could  be  lost  through  misappropriation  or  breach  of  our  confidentiality  and  license  agreements,  and  any  of  our
intellectual property rights may be challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. There
can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products, services, or technologies
that are substantially similar to ours and that compete with our business.

We do not intend to monetize our patents or attempt to block third parties from competing with us by asserting our patents offensively, but
our ability to successfully defend intellectual property challenges from competitors and other parties may depend, in part and where permissible,
on our ability to counter-assert our patents defensively. Effective protection of our intellectual property may be expensive and difficult to maintain,
both  in  terms  of  application  and  registration  costs  as  well  as  the  costs  of  defending  and  enforcing  those  rights. As  we  have  grown,  we  have
sought to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights in an increasing number of countries, a process that can be expensive and may not
always

91

Table of Contents

be successful. In some instances, patent applications or patents may be abandoned or allowed to lapse, resulting in partial or complete loss of
patent rights in a relevant jurisdiction. Further, intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products
and  services  are  available,  and  the  regulatory  landscape  in  such  jurisdictions  may  evolve  rapidly,  leading  to  an  unanticipated  change  in  the
ability  to  obtain  and  enforce  intellectual  property  rights  in  these  jurisdictions.  For  example,  some  foreign  countries  have  compulsory  licensing
laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain
third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. We may
also  agree  to  license  our  patents  to  third  parties  as  part  of  various  patent  pools  and  open  patent  projects.  Those  licenses  may  diminish  our
ability, though, to counter-assert our patents against certain parties that may bring claims against us.

We have been, and in the future may be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.

In  recent  years,  there  has  been  considerable  patent,  copyright,  trademark,  domain  name,  trade  secret,  and  other  intellectual  property
development activity in the cryptoeconomy, as well as litigation, based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property,
including by large financial institutions. Furthermore, individuals and groups can purchase patents and other intellectual property assets for the
purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like ours. Our use of third-party intellectual property rights also
may be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation. We cannot guarantee that our internally developed or acquired technologies and
content do not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that
we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Any claims or
litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or
ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our products or services or using certain technologies, force us to implement expensive or
less effective work-arounds, or impose other unfavorable terms. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the
crypto assets market grows and matures. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase and this could
further exhaust our financial and management resources. Further, during the course of any litigation, we may make announcements regarding
the  results  of  hearings  and  motions,  and  other  interim  developments.  If  securities  analysts  and  investors  regard  these  announcements  as
negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. Even if intellectual property claims do not result in litigation or are resolved
in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and require
significant  expenditures. Any  of  the  foregoing  could  prevent  us  from  competing  effectively  and  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating
results, and financial condition.

Our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open
source software licenses could harm our business.

Our platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. We also make certain of our own
software available to users for free under various open source licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks
than  use  of  third-party  commercial  software,  as  open  source  licensors  generally  do  not  provide  support,  warranties,  indemnification  or  other
contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it
easier for others to compromise our platform.

Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based
upon the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with
open  source  software  in  a  certain  manner,  we  could,  under  certain  open  source  licenses,  be  required  to  release  the  source  code  of  our
proprietary  software  to  the  public.  This  would  allow  our  competitors  to  create  similar  offerings  with  lower  development  effort  and  time  and
ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive

92

Table of Contents

advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time
and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.

We  have  not  recently  conducted  an  extensive  audit  of  our  use  of  open  source  software  and,  as  a  result,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  our
processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform are, or will be, effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to
fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face litigation, infringement claims, or other liabilities.
Likewise, we may be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically
feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely
basis  or  to  make  generally  available,  in  source  code  form,  our  proprietary  code,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating
results,  and  financial  condition.  Moreover,  the  terms  of  many  open  source  licenses  have  not  been  interpreted  by  U.S.  or  foreign  courts. As  a
result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to
provide  or  distribute  our  platform.  From  time  to  time,  there  have  been  claims  challenging  the  ownership  of  open  source  software  against
companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership
of what we believe to be open source software.

Risks Related to Our Employees and Other Service Providers

The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We operate in a relatively new industry that is not widely understood and requires highly skilled and technical personnel. We believe that our
future success is highly dependent on the talents and contributions of our senior management team, including Mr. Armstrong, our co-founder and
Chief  Executive  Officer,  members  of  our  executive  team,  and  other  key  employees  across  product,  engineering,  risk  management,  finance,
compliance  and  legal,  and  marketing.  Our  future  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract,  develop,  motivate,  and  retain  highly  qualified  and
skilled employees. The pool of qualified talent in our industry is extremely limited, particularly with respect to executive talent, engineering, risk
management,  and  financial  regulatory  expertise.  We  face  intense  competition  for  qualified  individuals  from  numerous  software  and  other
technology companies. To attract and retain key personnel, we incur significant costs, including salaries and benefits and equity incentives. Even
so, these measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. The loss of even a few
key  employees  or  senior  leaders,  or  an  inability  to  attract,  retain  and  motivate  additional  highly  skilled  employees  required  for  the  planned
expansion of our business could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow.

Our culture emphasizes innovation, and if we cannot maintain this culture, our business, operating results, and financial condition
could be adversely affected.

We  believe  that  our  entrepreneurial  and  innovative  corporate  culture  has  been  a  key  contributor  to  our  success.  We  encourage  and
empower  our  employees  to  develop  and  launch  new  and  innovative  products  and  services,  which  we  believe  is  essential  to  attracting  high
quality talent, partners, and developers, as well as serving the best, long-term interests of our company. If we cannot maintain this culture, we
could  lose  the  innovation,  creativity  and  teamwork  that  has  been  integral  to  our  business.  Additionally,  from  time  to  time,  we  realign  our
resources and talent to implement stage-appropriate business strategies, including furloughs, layoffs, or reductions in force. In such cases, we
may find it difficult to prevent a negative effect on employee morale or attrition beyond our planned reduction, in which case our products and
services may suffer and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

In the event of employee or service provider misconduct or error, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Employee  or  service  provider  misconduct  or  error  could  subject  us  to  legal  liability,  financial  losses,  and  regulatory  sanctions  and  could
seriously  harm  our  reputation  and  negatively  affect  our  business.  Such  misconduct  could  include  engaging  in  improper  or  unauthorized
transactions  or  activities,  misappropriation  of  customer  funds,  insider  trading  and  misappropriation  of  information,  failing  to  supervise  other
employees or service providers, improperly using confidential information, as well as improper trading activity such as spoofing, layering, wash
trading,  manipulation  and  front-running.  Employee  or  service  provider  errors,  including  mistakes  in  executing,  recording,  or  processing
transactions  for  customers,  could  expose  us  to  the  risk  of  material  losses  even  if  the  errors  are  detected.  Although  we  have  implemented
processes and procedures and provide trainings to our employees and service providers to reduce the likelihood of misconduct and error, these
efforts may not be successful. Moreover, the risk of employee or service provider error or misconduct may be even greater for novel products
and services and is compounded by the fact that many of our employees and service providers are accustomed to working at tech companies
which  generally  do  not  maintain  the  same  compliance  customs  and  rules  as  financial  services  firms.  This  can  lead  to  high  risk  of  confusion
among employees and service providers with respect to compliance obligations, particularly including confidentiality, data access, trading, and
conflicts. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all
cases.  If  we  were  found  to  have  not  met  our  regulatory  oversight  and  compliance  and  other  obligations,  we  could  be  subject  to  regulatory
sanctions, financial penalties, restrictions on our activities for failure to properly identify, monitor and respond to potentially problematic activity
and seriously damage our reputation. Our employees, contractors, and agents could also commit errors that subject us to financial claims for
negligence, as well as regulatory actions, or result in financial liability. Further, allegations by regulatory or criminal authorities of improper trading
activities could affect our brand and reputation.

Our officers, directors, employees, and large stockholders may encounter potential conflicts of interests with respect to their
positions or interests in certain crypto assets, entities, and other initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.

We  frequently  engage  in  a  wide  variety  of  transactions  and  maintain  relationships  with  a  significant  number  of  crypto  projects,  their
developers,  members  of  their  ecosystem,  and  investors.  These  transactions  and  relationships  could  create  potential  conflicts  of  interests  in
management  decisions  that  we  make.  For  instance,  certain  of  our  officers,  directors,  and  employees  are  active  investors  in  crypto  projects
themselves, and may make investment decisions that favor projects that they have personally invested in. Many of our large stockholders also
make  investments  in  these  crypto  projects.  In  addition,  our  co-founder  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr. Armstrong,  is  involved  in  a  number  of
initiatives  related  to  the  cryptoeconomy  and  more  broadly.  For  example,  Mr.  Armstrong  currently  serves  as  the  chief  executive  officer  of
ResearchHub  Technologies,  Inc.,  a  scientific  research  development  platform.  This  and  other  initiatives  he  is  involved  in  could  divert  Mr.
Armstrong's  time  and  attention  from  overseeing  our  business  operations  which  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  business.  Moreover,  we
may in the future be subject to litigation as a result of his involvement with these other initiatives.

Similarly, certain of our directors, officers, employees, and large stockholders may hold crypto assets that we are considering supporting for
trading  on  our  platform,  and  may  be  more  supportive  of  such  listing  notwithstanding  legal,  regulatory,  and  other  issues  associated  with  such
crypto  assets.  While  we  have  instituted  policies  and  procedures  to  limit  and  mitigate  such  risks,  there  is  no  assurance  that  such  policies  and
procedures  will  be  effective,  or  that  we  will  be  able  to  manage  such  conflicts  of  interests  adequately.  If  we  fail  to  manage  these  conflicts  of
interests, or we receive unfavorable media coverage with respect to actual or perceived conflicts of interest, our business could be harmed and
the brand, reputation and credibility of our company could be adversely affected.

General Risk Factors

Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our business.

Our performance is subject to general economic conditions, and their impact on the crypto asset markets and our customers. The United
States  and  other  key  international  economies  have  experienced  cyclical  downturns  from  time  to  time  in  which  economic  activity  declined
resulting  in  lower  consumption  rates,  restricted  credit,  reduced  profitability,  weaknesses  in  financial  markets,  bankruptcies,  and  overall
uncertainty  with  respect  to  the  economy. Adverse  general  economic  conditions  have  impacted  in  the  past,  and  may  impact  in  the  future,  the
cryptoeconomy,  although  the  extent  of  such  impacts  remains  uncertain  and  dependent  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  market  adoption  of
crypto  assets,  global  trends  in  the  cryptoeconomy,  central  bank  monetary  policies,  instability  in  the  global  banking  system,  volatility  and
disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and other events beyond our control. Geopolitical developments, such as trade wars and foreign
exchange limitations can also increase the severity and levels of unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial and crypto
asset  markets.  For  example,  in  the  past  the  capital  and  credit  markets  have  experienced  extreme  volatility  and  disruptions,  resulting  in  steep
declines in the value of crypto assets. To the extent general economic conditions and crypto assets markets materially deteriorate or decline for
a  prolonged  period,  our  ability  to  generate  revenue  and  to  attract  and  retain  customers  could  suffer  and  our  business,  operating  results  and
financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, even if general economic conditions were to improve following any such deterioration,
there is no guarantee that the cryptoeconomy would similarly improve.

Further, in 2022, a number of blockchain protocols and crypto financial firms, and in particular protocols and firms involving high levels of
financial  leverage  such  as  high-yield  lending  products  or  derivatives  trading,  suffered  from  insolvency  and  liquidity  crises  leading  to  the  2022
Events. Some of the 2022 Events are alleged or have been held to be the result of fraudulent activity by insiders, including misappropriation of
customer  funds  and  other  illicit  activity  and  internal  controls  failures.  In  connection  with  the  2022  Events,  concerns  were  raised  about  the
potential for a market condition where the failure of one company leads to the financial distress of other companies, which has the potential to
depress the prices of assets used as collateral by other firms. If such a market condition were to become widespread in the cryptoeconomy, we
could  suffer  from  increased  counterparty  risk,  including  defaults  or  bankruptcies  of  major  customers  or  counterparties,  which  could  lead  to
significantly reduced activity on our platform and fewer available crypto market opportunities in general. Further, forced selling of crypto assets
by distressed companies could lead to lower crypto asset prices and may lead to a reduction in our revenue. To the extent that conditions in the
general economic and crypto asset markets were to materially deteriorate, our ability to attract and retain customers may suffer.

Actual  events  involving  limited  liquidity,  defaults,  non-performance  or  other  adverse  developments  that  affect  financial  institutions,
transactional  counterparties  or  other  companies  in  the  financial  services  industry,  or  the  financial  services  industry  generally,  or  concerns  or
rumors about any such events or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example,
in  March  2023,  Silvergate  Capital  Corp.  announced  it  would  wind  down  operations  and  liquidate  Silvergate  Bank.  Soon  after,  the  FDIC  was
appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In connection with these issues and issues with other financial institutions, the
prices of fiat-backed stablecoins, including USDC, were temporarily impacted and may be similarly impacted again in the future. Further, if the
instability in the global banking system continues or worsens, there could be additional negative ramifications, such as additional all market-wide
liquidity problems or impacted access to deposits and investments for customers of affected financial institutions and certain partners, and our
business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We are a remote-first company which subjects us to heightened operational risks.

Our employees and service providers work from home and we are a remote-first company. This subjects us to heightened operational risks.

For example, technologies in our employees’ and service

95

Table of Contents

providers’  homes  may  not  be  as  robust  as  in  our  offices  and  could  cause  the  networks,  information  systems,  applications,  and  other  tools
available to employees and service providers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. Further, the security systems in place at our
employees’  and  service  providers’  homes  may  be  less  secure  than  those  used  in  our  offices,  and  while  we  have  implemented  technical  and
administrative safeguards to help protect our systems as our employees and service providers work from home, we may be subject to increased
cybersecurity risk, which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, and could disrupt our business operations. There is no guarantee that
the  data  security  and  privacy  safeguards  we  have  put  in  place  will  be  completely  effective  or  that  we  will  not  encounter  risks  associated  with
employees and service providers accessing company data and systems remotely. We also face challenges due to the need to operate with the
remote workforce and are addressing those challenges to minimize the impact on our ability to operate.

Environmental, social, and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.

There is focus from certain investors, regulators, employees, users and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically
related  to  environmental,  social,  and  governance  matters  (“ESG”)  and  related  assurances  and  disclosures.  Compliance  with  recently  adopted
and potential upcoming ESG requirements, including the E.U.’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and Corporate Sustainability Due
Diligence Directive and California’s climate-related bills, may require the dedication of significant time and resources. If we are unable to comply
with new laws and regulations or changes to existing legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or if we fail to meet investor,
industry, or stakeholder expectations and standards relating to ESG matters, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain
from  using  our  products  and  services,  we  may  be  subject  to  fines,  penalties,  regulatory  or  other  enforcement  actions,  and  our  business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, as well as the application of such laws, could adversely affect our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

We are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in the United States and a variety of foreign jurisdictions. All of these jurisdictions have in
the  past  and  may  in  the  future  make  changes  to  their  corporate  income  tax  rates  and  other  income  tax  laws  which  could  increase  our  future
income tax provision. For example, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by earnings that are lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and by earnings that are higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory
rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  by  changes  in  the  amount  of  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  or  by
changes  in  tax  laws,  regulations,  accounting  principles,  or  interpretations  thereof,  including  changes  with  possible  retroactive  application  or
effect.

Our determination of our tax liability is subject to review and may be challenged by applicable U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse
outcome of such a challenge could harm our operating results and financial condition. The determination of our worldwide provision for income
taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax determination is complex and uncertain. Moreover, as a multinational business, we have subsidiaries that engage in many
intercompany transactions in a variety of tax jurisdictions where the ultimate tax determination is complex and uncertain. Our existing corporate
structure  and  intercompany  arrangements  have  been  implemented  in  a  manner  we  believe  is  in  compliance  with  current  prevailing  tax  laws.
Furthermore,  as  we  operate  in  multiple  taxing  jurisdictions,  the  application  of  tax  laws  can  be  subject  to  diverging  and  sometimes  conflicting
interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views
with respect to, among other things, the characterization and source of income or other tax items, the manner in which the arm’s-length standard
is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which
we operate may challenge our tax treatment of certain items or the methodologies we use for valuing

96

Table of Contents

developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and
operating results.

Further,  any  changes  in  the  tax  laws  governing  our  activities  may  increase  our  tax  expense,  the  amount  of  taxes  we  pay,  or  both.  For
example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly reformed the U.S. federal tax code, reducing the
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, making sweeping changes to the rules governing international business operations, and imposing new
limitations  on  a  number  of  tax  benefits,  including  deductions  for  business  interest  and  the  use  of  net  operating  loss  carryforwards.  Effective
beginning in 2022, the TCJA also eliminated the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures and required taxpayers to
amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation
Reduction Act”), enacted on August 16, 2022, further amended the U.S. federal tax code, imposing a 15% minimum tax on “adjusted financial
statement income” of certain corporations as well as an excise tax on the repurchase or redemption of stock by certain corporations, beginning
in the 2023 tax year. In addition, over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on
a  Base  Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  Project  that,  if  implemented,  would  change  various  aspects  of  the  existing  framework  under  which  our  tax
obligations  are  determined  in  many  of  the  countries  in  which  we  do  business.  As  of  December  2024,  over  140  countries  have  approved  a
framework  that  imposes  a  minimum  tax  rate  of  15%,  among  other  provisions.  As  this  framework  is  subject  to  further  negotiation  and
implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. There can be
no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax, impose new limitations on deductions, credits or
other tax benefits, or make other changes that could impact our cash flows and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

In  addition,  the  IRS  has  yet  to  issue  guidance  on  a  number  of  important  issues  regarding  the  tax  treatment  of  cryptocurrency  and  the
products we provide to our customers and from which we derive our income. In the absence of such guidance, we will take positions with respect
to any such unsettled issues. There is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties
and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our business, cash flows or financial performance.

We  also  are  subject  to  non-income  taxes,  such  as  payroll,  sales,  use,  value-added,  digital  services,  net  worth,  property,  and  goods  and
services  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Specifically,  we  may  be  subject  to  new  allocations  of  tax  as  a  result  of
increasing efforts by certain jurisdictions to tax activities that may not have been subject to tax under existing tax principles. Companies such as
ours may be adversely impacted by such taxes. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. As a result, we may have
exposure to additional tax liabilities that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As  a  result  of  these  and  other  factors,  the  ultimate  amount  of  tax  obligations  owed  may  differ  from  the  amounts  recorded  in  our  financial
statements and any such difference may harm our operating results in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or
in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.

Our ability to use our deferred tax assets may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. or foreign law.

Realization of our deferred tax assets, in the form of future domestic or foreign tax deductions, credits or other tax benefits, will depend on
future taxable income, and there is a risk that some or all of such tax assets could be subject to limitation or otherwise unavailable to offset future
income tax liabilities, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. For example, future changes in our stock ownership, the causes of
which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
which could limit our use of such tax assets in

97

Table of Contents

certain circumstances. Similarly, additional changes may be made to U.S. (federal and state) and foreign tax laws which could further limit our
ability to fully utilize these tax assets against future taxable income.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, our ability to utilize tax deductions or losses from prior years may be limited by the imposition of the 15%
minimum tax if such minimum tax applies to us. Therefore, we may be required to pay additional U.S. federal income taxes despite any available
tax deductions, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, credits, or other tax benefits that we accumulate.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through our international operations could have a negative impact on our
operating  results  and  financial  condition.  From  time  to  time,  we  may  engage  in  currency  hedging  activities  to  limit  our  exposure  to  foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations that arise in the normal course of business. The use of hedging instruments may not offset any or more than
a  portion  of  the  adverse  financial  effects  of  unfavorable  movements  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  and  may  introduce  additional  risks  if  we  are
unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.

If our estimates or judgment relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be
adversely affected.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We
base  our  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  as
provided  in  the  section  titled  “Management’s  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations—Critical Accounting
Estimates” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying  values  of  assets,  liabilities,  and  equity,  and  the  amount  of  expenses  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  Significant
estimates  and  judgments  that  comprise  our  critical  accounting  estimates  involve  the  valuation  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in
business  combinations,  valuation  of  strategic  investments,  evaluation  of  tax  positions,  and  evaluation  of  legal  and  other  contingencies.  Our
business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from
those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to differ from the expectations of analysts and investors, resulting in a decline
in the trading price of our Class A common stock.

We may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as
terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately
protect us from a serious disaster.

Natural  disasters  or  other  catastrophic  events  may  also  cause  damage  or  disruption  to  our  operations,  international  commerce,  and  the
global  economy,  and  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Our  business  operations  are
subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, and other events beyond our control. In addition, our global operations expose
us  to  risks  associated  with  public  health  crises,  such  as  pandemics  and  epidemics,  which  could  harm  our  business  and  cause  our  operating
results to suffer. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related precautionary measures that we adopted have in the past resulted, and
could  in  the  future  result,  in  difficulties  or  changes  to  our  customer  support,  or  create  operational  or  other  challenges,  any  of  which  could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, acts of terrorism, labor activism or unrest, and other geopolitical
unrest, including ongoing regional conflicts around the world, could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the
economy as a whole. In the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard, or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a
fire, power loss, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational
harm,

98

Table of Contents

delays in development of our platform, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have
an adverse effect on our future operating results. We do not maintain insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses
that could result from disruptions to our services. Additionally, all the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a
disaster  recovery  plan  or  our  partners’  disaster  recovery  plans  prove  to  be  inadequate.  To  the  extent  natural  disasters  or  other  catastrophic
events  concurrently  impact  data  centers  we  rely  on  in  connection  with  private  key  restoration,  customers  will  experience  significant  delays  in
withdrawing funds, or in the extreme we may suffer loss of customer funds.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting, our
ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.

As a public company we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the
SEC require, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In
order  to  maintain  and,  if  required,  improve  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  meet  this
standard,  we  have  expended,  and  anticipate  that  we  will  continue  to  expend,  significant  resources,  including  accounting-related  costs  and
significant management oversight. If we encounter material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may
not detect errors on a timely basis and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be materially misstated.

Any  failure  to  implement  and  maintain  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  also  adversely  affect  the  results  of  periodic
management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal
control  over  financial  reporting  that  are  required  to  be  included  in  our  periodic  reports  filed  with  the  SEC.  Ineffective  disclosure  controls  and
procedures or internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, negatively impact the price
of our Class A common stock and have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.

We  have  funded  our  operations  since  inception  primarily  through  equity  financings,  debt,  and  cash  flows  generated  from  operations.  We
cannot be certain that our operations will continue to fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make
investments in our business, which investments may require us to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms
favorable to us, if at all, including due to general macroeconomic conditions, crypto market conditions and any disruptions in the crypto market,
instability in the global banking system, increasing regulatory uncertainty and scrutiny or other unforeseen factors. In the event of a downgrade
of our credit rating, our ability to raise additional financing may be adversely affected and any future debt offerings or credit arrangements we
propose to enter into may be on less favorable terms or terms that may not be acceptable to us. In addition, even if debt financing is available,
the cost of additional financing may be significantly higher than our current debt. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights
senior to holders of our common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability
to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, we have authorized the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock and common stock that
our  board  of  directors  could  use  to,  among  other  things,  issue  shares  of  our  capital  stock  in  the  form  of  blockchain  tokens,  implement  a
stockholder rights plan, or issue other shares of preferred stock or common stock. We may issue shares of capital stock, including in the form of
blockchain  tokens,  to  our  customers  in  connection  with  customer  reward  or  loyalty  programs.  If  we  issue  additional  equity  securities,
stockholders  will  experience  dilution,  and  the  new  equity  securities  could  have  rights  senior  to  those  of  our  currently  authorized  and  issued
common  stock.  The  trading  prices  for  our  common  stock  may  be  highly  volatile,  which  may  reduce  our  ability  to  access  capital  on  favorable
terms or at all. In addition, a

99

Table of Contents

slowdown  or  other  sustained  adverse  downturn  in  the  general  economic  or  crypto  asset  markets  could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  the
value of our Class A common stock. Because our decision to raise capital in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors
beyond  our  control,  we  cannot  predict  or  estimate  the  amount,  timing,  or  nature  of  any  future  issuances  of  securities.  As  a  result,  our
stockholders  bear  the  risk  of  future  issuances  of  debt  or  equity  securities  reducing  the  value  of  our  Class A  common  stock  and  diluting  their
interests.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and could decline significantly and rapidly. Market volatility may affect
the value of an investment in our Class A common stock and could subject us to litigation.

Prior to the listing of our Class A common stock on Nasdaq, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. Technology
stocks  have  historically  experienced  high  levels  of  volatility.  The  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  also  could  be  subject  to  wide
fluctuations in response to the risk factors described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and others beyond our control, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the number of shares of our Class A common stock publicly owned and available for trading;

overall performance of the equity markets or publicly-listed financial services and technology companies;

our actual or anticipated operating performance and the operating performance of our competitors;

changes in the projected operational and financial results we provide to the public or our failure to meet those projections;

failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow
our company, or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;

any major change in our board of directors, management, or key personnel;

if we issue additional shares of capital stock, including in the form of blockchain tokens, in connection with customer reward or loyalty
programs;

issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our
outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes;

repurchases  by  us  of  any  of  our  outstanding  shares  of  Class A  common  stock,  including  under  the  Share  Repurchase  Program,  on
unfavorable terms or at all;

the highly volatile nature of the cryptoeconomy and the prices of crypto assets;

rumors and market speculation involving the cryptoeconomy and the regulation thereof, or us or other companies in our industry;

announcements  by  us  or  our  competitors  of  significant  innovations,  new  products,  services,  features,  integrations  or  capabilities,
acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; and

other events or factors, including those resulting from political instability and acts of war or terrorism, regional conflicts around the world,
government shutdowns, bank failures, or responses to these events.

Furthermore, the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the
market  prices  of  equity  securities  of  many  companies  and  financial  services  and  technology  companies  in  particular. These  fluctuations  often
have been unrelated

100

Table of Contents

or  disproportionate  to  the  operating  performance  of  those  companies.  These  broad  market  and  industry  fluctuations,  as  well  as  general
macroeconomic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively
impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock
have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are currently subject to stockholder litigation, as described in the section titled “Legal
Proceedings” in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and may continue to be the target of these types of actions or additional
regulatory  uncertainty  and  scrutiny  in  the  future.  Securities  or  regulatory  actions  against  us  could  result  in  substantial  costs  and  divert  our
management’s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.

The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders, including our
directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders, and their respective affiliates. As a result of this structure, our Chief Executive
Officer has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock. This ownership will limit or
preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents,
and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder
approval.

Our Class B common stock has twenty votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Mr. Armstrong is currently
able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and, along with our directors, other
executive officers, and 5% stockholders, and their affiliates, these stockholders hold in the aggregate a substantial majority of the voting power
of our capital stock. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock, the holders of
our Class B common stock, including Mr. Armstrong, collectively are expected to continue to control a significant percentage of the combined
voting  power  of  our  common  stock  and  therefore  be  able  to  control  all  matters  submitted  to  our  stockholders  for  approval  until  the  earliest  to
occur of (i) the date fixed by the board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days after the date that the aggregate
number of shares of Class B common stock held by Brian Armstrong and his affiliates is less than 25% of the aggregate number of shares of
Class B common stock held by Mr. Armstrong and his affiliates on April 1, 2021, the date of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form
S-1 for the listing of our Class A common stock on Nasdaq; (ii) the date and time specified by affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3%
of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class, and the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the then serving
members of our board of directors, which must include the affirmative vote of Mr. Armstrong, if either (A) Mr. Armstrong is serving on our board of
directors  and  has  not  been  terminated  for  cause  or  resigned  except  for  good  reason  (as  each  term  is  defined  in  our  restated  certificate  of
incorporation)  from  his  position  as  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  (B)  Mr.  Armstrong  has  not  been  removed  for  cause  or  resigned  from  the
position  of  Chairman  of  the  board  of  directors;  and  (iii)  the  death  or  disability  (as  defined  in  our  restated  certificate  of  incorporation)  of  Mr.
Armstrong, when all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will convert automatically into shares of Class A common stock. Holders of our
Class A common stock are not entitled to vote separately as a single class except under certain limited circumstances. This concentrated control
may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our
organizational  documents,  and  any  merger,  consolidation,  sale  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets,  or  other  major  corporate  transaction
requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that
you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. In addition, Mr. Armstrong has the ability to control the management and
major  strategic  investments  of  our  company  as  a  result  of  his  position  as  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  his  ability  to  control  the  election  or
replacement of our directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Armstrong owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith
in  a  manner  he  reasonably  believes  to  be  in  the  best  interests  of  our  stockholders.  As  a  stockholder,  even  a  controlling  stockholder,  Mr.
Armstrong is entitled to vote his

101

Table of Contents

shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to
limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common
stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock, including Mr. Armstrong,
who retain their shares in the long term. Moreover, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock
could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock.

The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.

Certain stock index providers exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to certain stock indices.
In addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual
class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices, may cause stockholder advisory
firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure,
and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our Class A common stock. Any exclusion from stock indices could result
in less demand for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our
corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.

Sales or distribution of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales or distributions might
occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

The sale or distribution of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock, particularly sales by us or our directors, executive
officers,  and  principal  stockholders,  or  the  perception  that  these  sales  or  distributions  might  occur  in  large  quantities,  could  cause  the  market
price of our Class A common stock to decline.

In addition, we have filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. All of
the  shares  of  Class  A  common  stock  and  Class  B  common  stock  issuable  upon  the  exercise  of  stock  options  or  vesting  and  settlement  of
restricted  stock  units  and  performance  restricted  stock  units  will  be  able  to  be  freely  sold  in  the  public  market  upon  issuance,  subject  to
applicable vesting requirements and compliance by affiliates with Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

Further,  certain  holders  of  shares  of  our  common  stock  will  have  rights,  subject  to  some  conditions,  to  require  us  to  file  registration
statements for the public resale of shares of Class A common stock or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or
other stockholders. Any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could
cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or be volatile.

We also may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock, including in the form of blockchain tokens, from time to
time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, investments, pursuant to customer rewards, loyalty programs, and other incentive plans, or
otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common
stock to decline.

102

Table of Contents

If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about
our business, the price of our Class A common stock and its liquidity could decline.

The trading market for our Class A common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish
about us or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities and industry analysts
cease coverage of us altogether, the market price for our Class A common stock may be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who
cover  us  downgrade  our  Class A  common  stock,  or  publish  inaccurate  or  unfavorable  research  about  our  business,  the  price  of  our  Class A
common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class
A  common  stock  could  decrease,  which  might  cause  our  Class  A  common  stock  price  and  trading  volume  to  decline.  In  light  of  the
unpredictability inherent in our business, our financial outlook commentary may differ from analysts’ expectations, which could cause volatility to
the price of our Class A common stock.

We cannot guarantee that the Share Repurchase Program will be fully consummated or that such program will enhance the long-term
value of our Class A common stock price.

In October 2024, our board of directors authorized and approved the Share Repurchase Program, which provides for the repurchase of up to
$1.0  billion  of  our  outstanding  Class  A  common  stock  without  expiration.  Repurchases  may  be  made  from  time  to  time  in  the  open  market
(including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act), in privately negotiated transactions, or by other
methods  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  federal  and  state  laws  and  regulations.  The  timing  of  any  repurchases  will  depend  on  market
conditions and will be made at our discretion. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number
of shares of our Class A common stock, and the program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

The Share Repurchase Program could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase the volatility thereof. Price volatility may
cause the average price at which we repurchase our Class A common stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time.
There can be no assurance that the Share Repurchase Program will have a positive impact on our Class A common stock price or net income
(loss)  per  share.  Important  factors  that  could  cause  us  to  discontinue  or  decrease  share  repurchases  under  the  Share  Repurchase  Program
include, among others: unfavorable market conditions; the market price of our Class A common stock; the nature of other investment or strategic
opportunities presented to us from time to time; our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to
repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program; and the availability of funds necessary to fulfill such repurchases.

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, and certain rules imposed by regulatory authorities, could make an
acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove
our current management, limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,
officers, or employees, and limit the price of our Class A common stock.

Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition,
or  other  change  of  control  of  our  company  that  the  stockholders  may  consider  favorable.  In  addition,  because  our  board  of  directors  is
responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to
replace  or  remove  our  current  management  by  making  it  more  difficult  for  stockholders  to  replace  members  of  our  board  of  directors.  Our
restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws include provisions that:

•

permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;

103

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;

authorize  the  issuance  of  “blank  check”  preferred  stock  and  common  stock  that  our  board  of  directors  could  use  to  implement  a
stockholder rights plan or issue other shares of preferred stock or common stock, including blockchain tokens;

provide  that  only  our  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  chairperson  of  our  board  of  directors,  or  a  majority  of  our  board  of  directors  will  be
authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;

eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;

prohibit cumulative voting;

provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of
matters  requiring  stockholder  approval,  even  if  they  own  significantly  less  than  a  majority  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  our  Class  A
common stock and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or
other sale of our company or its assets;

provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our restated bylaws; and

provide for advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted
upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.

Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our
company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between holders of 15% or more
of our common stock and us.

In addition, a third party attempting to acquire us or a substantial position in our common stock may be delayed or ultimately prevented from
doing so by change in ownership or control regulations to which our regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject. FINRA Rule 1017 generally
provides  that  FINRA  approval  must  be  obtained  in  connection  with  any  transaction  resulting  in  a  single  person  or  entity  owning,  directly  or
indirectly, 25% or more of a member firm’s equity and would include a change of control of a parent company.

Our restated certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision for certain claims, which could limit our stockholders’
ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is
the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim that is based upon a breach of
fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of ours, arising
pursuant to the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; any action asserting a claim against us that is governed
by the internal affairs doctrine; or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL.

Moreover, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any
duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the
federal district courts of the United States of America are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint
asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum. Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding
that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or

104

Table of Contents

state  courts  will  follow  the  holding  of  the  Delaware  Supreme  Court  or  determine  that  the  Federal  Forum  Provision  should  be  enforced  in  a
particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created
by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive
federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
The Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by  law.  Accordingly,  actions  by  our  stockholders  to  enforce  any  duty  or  liability  created  by  the  Exchange  Act  or  the  rules  and  regulations
thereunder must be brought in federal court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws
and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and
consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring
a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits
against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our
restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such
action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In October 2024, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of the Company’s Class A common stock without
expiration.  The  Share  Repurchase  Program  does  not  obligate  the  Company  to  repurchase  any  dollar  amount  or  number  of  shares  of  the
Company’s Class A common stock, and the program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. As of March 31, 2025, no shares
have been repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program.
