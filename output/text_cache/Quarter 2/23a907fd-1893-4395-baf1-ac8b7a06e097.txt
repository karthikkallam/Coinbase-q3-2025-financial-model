Table of Contents

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business,
financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  and  prospects. The  outcome  of  the  events  described  in  these  forward-looking  statements  is  subject  to  risks,
uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
and  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q.  Moreover,  we  operate  in  a  very  competitive  and  rapidly  changing  environment.  New  risks  and
uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on any forward-looking
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-
looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in such forward-
looking statements.

Neither we nor any other person assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. Moreover, the
forward-looking  statements  made  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  relate  only  to  events  as  of  the  date  on  which  the  statements  are  made.  We
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We
may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on
our  forward-looking  statements.  Our  forward-looking  statements  do  not  reflect  the  potential  impact  of  any  future  acquisitions,  mergers,  dispositions,
restructurings, joint ventures, partnerships, or investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based
upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis
for  such  statements,  such  information  may  be  limited  or  incomplete,  and  our  statements  should  not  be  read  to  indicate  that  we  have  conducted  an
exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned
not to unduly rely upon these statements.

RISK FACTORS SUMMARY

Consistent with the foregoing, our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at length below. These

risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks:

• Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto;

• Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform. If such price
or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected and the price of our Class A common
stock could decline;

• Our  net  revenue  may  be  concentrated  in  a  limited  number  of  areas.  Within  transaction  revenue  and  subscription  and  services  revenue,  a
meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC, respectively. If revenue
from these areas declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets or other products and services, our business, operating results,
and financial condition could be adversely affected;

• We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties. If we
are  unsuccessful  in  establishing  or  maintaining  strategic  relationships  with  these  third  parties  or  if  these  third  parties  fail  to  deliver  certain
operational services, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected;

•

Interest rate fluctuations could negatively impact us;

•

Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our business;

The future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If crypto does not grow as
we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected;

Cyberattacks  and  security  breaches  of  our  platform,  or  those  impacting  our  customers  or  third  parties,  could  adversely  affect  our  brand,
reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition;

• We are subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with,

any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition;

• We  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  industry  and  we  compete  against  unregulated  or  less  regulated  companies  and  companies  with  greater
financial  and  other  resources,  and  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected  if  we  are  unable  to
compete effectively;

• We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business, operating results, and financial condition

could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively;

•

As we continue to expand and localize our international activities, our obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of a
variety of jurisdictions will increase and we may be subject to inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators
and governmental authorities, including those related to sanctions, export control, and anti-money laundering;

• We are, and may continue to be, subject to litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits, as well as investigations and enforcement
actions by regulators and governmental authorities. These matters are often expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition;

•

•

If we cannot keep pace with rapid industry changes to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services,
and consequently our net revenue, could decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition;

A particular crypto asset, product or service’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and if we
are unable to properly characterize a crypto asset or product offering, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries, investigations, fines,
and other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition;

• We currently rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our operations, and any interruptions in services provided by these third

parties may impair our ability to support our customers;

•

•

Loss of a critical financial institution or insurance relationship could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition;

Any significant disruption in our products and services, in our information technology systems, or in any of the blockchain networks we support,
could result in a loss of customers or funds and adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition;

• Our failure to securely store and manage our and our customers’ fiat currencies and crypto assets could adversely affect our business, operating

results, and financial condition; and

•

The theft, loss, or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account or for our customers may
be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our ability to access any
crypto assets, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses.

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Coinbase Global, Inc.

(unaudited)

Coinbase, Inc. was founded in 2012. In April 2014, in connection with a corporate reorganization, Coinbase, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary

of Coinbase Global, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”).

The  Company  provides  a  trusted  platform  that  serves  as  a  compliant  on-ramp  to  the  onchain  economy  and  enables  users  to  engage  in  a  wide
variety of activities with their crypto assets in both proprietary and third-party product experiences enabled by access to decentralized applications. The
Company offers (i) consumers their primary financial account for the cryptoeconomy, (ii) institutions a full-service prime brokerage platform with access
to deep pools of liquidity across the crypto marketplace, and (iii) developers a suite of products granting access to build onchain.

The  Company  is  remote-first  and  accordingly,  does  not  maintain  a  headquarters.  Substantially  all  of  the  Company’s  executive  team  meetings  are
held virtually, with meetings occasionally held in-person at locations that are either not in the Company’s offices or in various of the Company’s offices
distributed around the world. The Company holds all of its stockholder meetings virtually.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation and preparation

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries – entities in which the
Company  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  more  than  50%  of  the  voting  rights,  or  where  it  exercises  control.  The  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial
Statements are unaudited but have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) on the
same basis as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and in management’s opinion, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal, recurring
adjustments, that are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s Financial Statements. Preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
and notes thereto. Certain prior period amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
period’s  presentation.  The  unaudited  Condensed  Consolidated  Results  of  Operations  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2025  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other period and should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 13, 2025 (the “Annual Report”).

There were no material changes to the Company’s most significant estimates and assumptions, significant accounting policies, segment reporting, or
recent accounting pronouncements that were disclosed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the Annual Report, other than as discussed below.

Concentration of credit risk

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, customer custodial funds, USDC, loan receivables, certain crypto
assets  held,  accounts  receivable,  and  deposits  are  potentially  subject  to  concentration  of  credit  risk.  See  below  and  Notes  4.  Collateralized
Arrangements and Financing and 6. Accounts Receivable, Net for a discussion of these risks by counterparty and type of transaction.

Funds held at financial institutions

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and customer custodial funds are primarily placed with financial institutions which

are of high credit quality. The Company holds cash and

11

Table of Contents

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Coinbase Global, Inc.

(unaudited)

cash  equivalents  and  customer  custodial  funds  primarily  in  highly  liquid,  highly  rated  instruments  which  are  uninsured. The  Company  may  also  have
corporate deposit balances with financial institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000. The Company
has not experienced losses on these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to these accounts.

Funds held at trading venues, payment processors, and clearing brokers

The  Company  holds  cash,  restricted  cash  and  deposits,  and  crypto  assets  at  crypto  asset  trading  venues,  payment  processors,  and  clearing
brokers,  and  performs  a  regular  assessment  of  these  venues  as  part  of  its  risk  management  process.  As  of  June  30,  2025,  the  Company  held
$202.8 million at these venues, including $110.3 million in cash, $54.3 million in crypto assets, and $36.9 million in restricted cash. As of December 31,
2024, the Company held $88.2 million in cash at these venues.

USDC

The Company holds USDC, a stablecoin redeemable on a one-to-one basis for U.S. dollars and issued by Circle Internet Financial, LLC (“Circle”)
and  its  affiliate,  Circle  Internet  Financial  Europe  SAS.  USDC  is  accounted  for  as  a  financial  instrument  in  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.  Circle  reported  that,  as  of  June  30,  2025,  underlying  reserves  were  held  in  cash,  short-duration  U.S.  Treasuries,  and  overnight  U.S.
Treasury repurchase agreements within segregated accounts for the benefit of USDC holders.

The Company has operating leases for corporate offices. The leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than one year to 13 years, and
generally have options to extend or terminate the lease that were not accounted for in determining the lease terms as the Company is not reasonably
certain it will exercise those options.

(5) Represents marketable equity securities. Excludes strategic investments that are not measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis of $380.2 million and $374.2 million as of

(6) See Note 9. Derivatives for additional details.

The Company has valued all Level 2 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using quoted market prices as an observable
input. This includes prices for underlying crypto assets and, for non-crypto denominated assets and liabilities, prices for similar assets and liabilities in
inactive markets.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, there were net unrealized gains of $1.5 billion related to the Company’s marketable equity
securities  held  as  of  June  30,  2025.  There  were  no  realized  gains  or  losses  during  these  periods  as  no  marketable  equity  securities  were  sold,  and
nearly all of this investment balance is subject to restrictions as to disposition.

Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis

The  Company’s  non-financial  assets,  such  as  software  and  equipment,  goodwill,  and  other  intangible  assets,  are  adjusted  to  fair  value  when  an

impairment charge is recognized.

Nearly  all  of  the  Company’s  strategic  investments  measured  and  recorded  at  fair  value  on  a  non-recurring  basis  due  to  the  lack  of  readily
determinable  fair  values  are  accounted  for  using  the  measurement  alternative,  whereby  they  are  recognized  at  cost  and  adjusted  to  fair  value  for
observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment, on a non-recurring basis. Fair value measurements for
these  strategic  investments  are  based  predominantly  on  Level  3  inputs  to  an  Option-Pricing  Model  that  uses  publicly  available  market  data  of
comparable  companies  and  other  unobservable  inputs  including  expected  volatility,  expected  time  to  liquidity,  adjustments  for  other  company-specific
developments, and the rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds.

The impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from remeasurement of measurement alternative investments was immaterial
for all periods presented, as were cumulative upward adjustments of measurement alternative investments outstanding at June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024. Cumulative impairments and downward adjustments as of these dates were $121.6 million and $145.8 million, respectively.

Assets and liabilities not measured and recorded at fair value

Certain  of  the  Company’s  financial  instruments  are  not  measured  and  recorded  at  fair  value  because  carrying  values  of  these  instruments
approximate  their  fair  values  due  to  their  liquid  or  short-term  nature.  The  following  financial  instruments  denominated  in  fiat  or  USDC,  as  applicable,
would be based on Level 1 valuation inputs if they were recorded at fair value: cash, restricted cash, USDC, certain customer custodial funds and related
liabilities, collateral pledged, and obligations to return collateral. The following financial instruments denominated in fiat or USDC, as applicable, would be
based on Level 2 valuation inputs if they were recorded at fair value: accounts receivable, loan receivables, accounts payable, and long-term debt.

The  Company’s  long-term  debt  is  not  measured  and  recorded  at  fair  value.  See  Note  8.  Long-Term  Debt  for  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the

Company’s long-term debt.

The Company’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was 21.7% and 160.0%, respectively. The ETR of
21.7%  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2025  was  higher  than  the  U.S.  statutory  rate  of  21.0%,  primarily  due  to  the  Company’s  non-deductible
expenses and state tax, mostly offset by deductible stock-based compensation. The Company’s ETR for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
was  21.6%  and  12.0%,  respectively.  The  ETR  of  21.6%  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2025  was  higher  than  the  U.S.  statutory  rate  of  21.0%,
primarily due to the Company’s non-deductible expenses and state tax, mostly offset by deductible stock-based compensation.

As of June 30, 2025, the Company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $541.4 million, compared to $941.3 million as of December 31, 2024. As
of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax
assets. Management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Company’s net deferred tax
asset will be fully realized.

The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with
respect to voting. As a result, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting income or loss per share will, therefore,
be the same for both Class A common stock and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.

The following potentially dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect would have been anti-dilutive,
or in the case of performance awards, as the issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by
the end of the reporting period (in thousands):

incurred  any  losses  related  to  such  obligations  and  therefore  has  not  accrued  any  liabilities  as  of  each  June  30,  2025  and  December  31,  2024. The
Company holds crypto assets and USDC in custodial products on its platform on behalf of its customers totaling $425.0 billion and $404.0 billion at fair
value  at  June  30,  2025  and  December  31,  2024,  respectively.  These  assets  are  not  recognized  in  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.
Similarly,  as  the  Company  has  an  obligation  to  securely  store  all  of  these  assets,  it  has  a  corresponding  unrecognized  liability  of  $425.0  billion  and
$404.0  billion  at  June  30,  2025  and  December  31,  2024,  respectively.  Since  the  risk  of  loss  is  remote,  the  Company  did  not  recognize  a  contingent
liability at June 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. The Company has no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability
because (i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of
crypto assets within its control, and (iii) it has established security around custodial product private keys to minimize the risk of theft or loss.

Indemnifications

In the event any registrable securities are included in a registration statement, the Company’s Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement
(the “IRA”) entered into with certain of the Company’s stockholders provides indemnity to each stockholder, their partners, members, officers, directors,
and  stockholders  and  certain  of  their  advisors;  each  underwriter,  if  any;  and  each  person  who  controls  each  stockholder  or  underwriter,  against  any
damages incurred in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding arising as a result of such registration from which damages may
result. The Company will reimburse each such party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred, provided that the Company will not be
liable in any such case to the extent the damages arise out of or are based upon any actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished by or on behalf of such stockholder or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein.

The Company also has indemnity agreements with certain officers and directors of the Company pursuant to which the Company must indemnify the
officer or director against all expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred in connection with a third party proceeding,
if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and in the case
of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements: (i) because the facts and circumstances
involved in each claim are unique and the Company cannot predict the number or nature of claims that may be made; (ii) due to the unique facts and
circumstances  involved  in  each  particular  agreement;  and  (iii)  due  to  the  requirement  for  a  registration  of  the  Company’s  securities  before  any  of  the
indemnification obligations contemplated in the IRA become effective.

The Company has also provided indemnities or similar commitments on standard commercial terms in the ordinary course of business.

Legal and regulatory proceedings

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Coinbase Global, Inc.

(unaudited)

The Company is subject to various litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.
The Company is also subject to regulatory oversight by numerous regulatory and other governmental agencies, including at the federal and state levels
and  internationally.  The  Company  reviews  its  lawsuits,  regulatory  investigations,  and  other  legal  proceedings  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  provides
disclosure  and  recognizes  loss  contingencies  in  accordance  with  the  loss  contingencies  accounting  guidance.  In  accordance  with  such  guidance,  the
Company establishes accruals for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the Company determines
that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated,  the  Company  discloses  the  possible  loss  in  the  Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July and August 2021, three purported securities class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company,  its  directors,  certain  of  its  officers  and  employees,  and  certain  venture  capital  and  investment  firms.  The  complaints  alleged  violations  of
Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act, in connection with the registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with the Direct Listing.
In  November  2021,  these  actions  were  consolidated  and  recaptioned  as  In  re  Coinbase  Global  Securities  Litigation,  and  an  amended  complaint  was
filed. The  plaintiff  sought,  among  other  relief,  unspecified  compensatory  damages,  attorneys’  fees,  and  costs. The  Company  disputed  the  claims  and
vigorously  defended  against  them.  In  March  2025,  the  plaintiff  voluntarily  dismissed  this  action  and  the  court  entered  an  order  closing  the  case. The
resolution of this action did not have a material impact on the Company’s business and financial statements. The Company has subsequently received,
and expects to receive in the future, similar shareholder claims.

In October 2021, a purported class action captioned Underwood et al. v. Coinbase Global, Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging claims under Sections 5, 15(a)(1) and 29(b) of the Exchange Act, and violations
of certain California and Florida state statutes. On March 11, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Coinbase, Inc. and Brian Armstrong as
defendants and adding causes of action, including alleging claims under Sections 5, 12(a)(1) and 15 of the Securities Act and violations of certain New
Jersey state statutes. Among other relief requested, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 1,
2023, the District Court dismissed all federal claims (with prejudice) and state law claims (without prejudice) against Coinbase Global, Inc., Coinbase,
Inc. and Brian Armstrong. Subsequently, on February 9, 2023, the plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the
“Court of Appeals”), and the parties completed briefing the appeal on September 13, 2023. Oral argument took place on February 1, 2024 and on April 5,
2024,  the  Court  of Appeals  issued  a  Summary  Order  affirming  the  District  Court’s  dismissal  order  with  respect  to  the  claims  alleging  violations  of  the
Exchange Act, and reversing the District Court’s dismissal order with respect to the claims alleging violations of the Securities Act and violations of the
state  statutes.  On  June  27,  2024,  defendants  filed  an  answer  to  the  amended  complaint,  and  on  July  29,  2024,  the  defendants  filed  a  Motion  for
Judgment  on  the  Pleadings  requesting  the  District  Court  dismiss  the  remaining  claims.  On  February  7,  2025,  the  District  Court  denied  defendants’
Motion  for  Judgement  on  the  Pleadings  and  allowed  the  case  to  proceed  to  bifurcated  discovery,  followed  by  summary  judgment  motions.  The
defendants continue to dispute the claims in this case and intend to vigorously defend against them. Based on the nature of the proceedings in this case,
the outcome of this matter remains uncertain and the Company cannot estimate the potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this
time. The Company has subsequently received, and expects to receive in the future, similar class action claims.

In December 2021, a shareholder derivative suit captioned Shin v. Coinbase Global, Inc., was filed in New York state court against the Company and
its directors, alleging breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets, and seeking
unspecified  damages  and  injunctive  relief.  The  parties  have  voluntarily  dismissed  this  action  and  the  court  entered  an  order  closing  the  case.  The
resolution of this action did not have a material impact on the Company’s business and financial statements. The Company has subsequently received,
and expects to

receive in the future, similar derivative claims. The Company disputes the claims in these cases and intends to vigorously defend against them. Based
on  the  preliminary  nature  of  the  proceedings  in  these  cases,  the  outcome  of  these  matters  remain  uncertain  and  the  Company  cannot  estimate  the
potential impact, if any, on its business or financial statements at this time.

In  June  2023,  the  SEC  filed  a  complaint  in  the  District  Court  against  the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.  alleging  that  Coinbase,  Inc.  acted  as  an
unregistered  securities  exchange,  broker,  and  clearing  agency  in  violation  of  Sections  5,  15(a)  and  17A(b)  of  the  Exchange Act  and  that,  through  its
staking program, Coinbase, Inc. offered and sold securities without registering its offers and sales in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities
Act. The SEC also alleged that the Company is liable for the alleged violations as an alleged control person of Coinbase, Inc. The case was captioned
SEC v. Coinbase, Inc. et al. The SEC sought, among other relief, injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil money penalties. The Company and Coinbase,
Inc. filed an answer to the SEC complaint in June 2023, disputed the claims in the case, and vigorously defended against them. On August 4, 2023, the
Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.  filed  a  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings.  The  SEC  filed  its  response  on  October  3,  2023  and  the  Company  and
Coinbase, Inc. filed their reply on October 24, 2023. Oral argument took place on January 17, 2024. On March 27, 2024, the District Court denied in part
the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.’s  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings  with  respect  to  the  SEC’s  claims  that  Coinbase,  Inc.  operated  as  an
unregistered  securities  exchange,  broker,  and  clearing  agency  and  engaged  in  an  unregistered  offer  and  sale  of  securities  through  the  Company’s
staking program. The District Court dismissed the SEC’s claim that Coinbase, Inc. acted as an unregistered broker through its wallet service. On April 12,
2024, the Company and Coinbase, Inc. filed a motion with the District Court seeking certification of an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals. The
District Court granted that motion on January 7, 2025 and stayed proceedings in the District Court. On January 17, 2025, the Company and Coinbase,
Inc.  filed  a  petition  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeals.  On  February  28,  2025,  the  SEC  and  the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.  jointly
stipulated  to  dismissal  of  SEC  v.  Coinbase,  Inc.  et  al.  with  prejudice. The  case  is  now  concluded. The  resolution  of  the  SEC’s  lawsuit  did  not  have  a
material impact on the Company’s business and financial statements.

In June 2023, the Company and Coinbase, Inc. were issued notices, show-cause orders, and cease-and-desist letters, and became the subject of
various  legal  actions  initiated  by  U.S.  state  securities  regulators  in  the  states  of Alabama,  California,  Illinois,  Kentucky,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  South
Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin alleging violations of state securities laws with respect to staking services provided by Coinbase, Inc. In
July  2023,  the  Company  and  Coinbase,  Inc.  entered  into  agreements  with  state  securities  regulators  in  California,  New  Jersey,  South  Carolina  and
Wisconsin, pursuant to which customers in those states will no longer be able to stake new funds, in each case pending final adjudication of the matters.
In October 2023, the Company and Coinbase, Inc. entered into a similar agreement with the Maryland state securities regulator. In March and April 2025,
the  Alabama,  Kentucky,  Illinois,  South  Carolina,  and  Vermont  state  securities  regulators  dismissed,  vacated,  rescinded,  and/or  withdrew  their  legal
actions. The Company and Coinbase, Inc. dispute the claims of the state securities regulators and intend to vigorously defend against them. Based on
the preliminary nature of these actions, the final outcome of these matters remains uncertain and the Company cannot estimate the potential impact on
its business or financial statements at this time. An adverse resolution in these state matters could have a material impact on the Company’s business
and financial statements.

The Company has, from time to time, received investigative subpoenas and requests from regulators for documents and information, including about
certain  customer  programs,  operations,  and  existing  and  intended  future  products,  including  the  Company’s  processes  for  listing  assets,  the
classification of certain listed assets, its staking programs, and its stablecoin and yield-generating products.

Except as otherwise disclosed, the Company believes the ultimate resolution of existing legal and regulatory investigation matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. However, in light of the uncertainties inherent in
these matters, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations for a particular period, and future changes in circumstances

or additional information could result in additional accruals or resolution in excess of established accruals, which could adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations, potentially materially.

Tax regulation

Current  tax  rules  related  to  crypto  assets  are  evolving  and  require  significant  judgments  to  be  made  in  interpretation  of  the  law,  including  but  not
limited  to  the  areas  of  income  tax,  information  reporting,  value  added  taxes,  digital  services  tax,  transaction  level  taxes  and  the  withholding  of  tax  at
source. Further, it is possible that additional legislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. governing bodies that may differ significantly
from  the  Company's  practices  or  interpretation  of  the  law,  which  could  have  unforeseen  effects  on  the  Company’s  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations, and accordingly, the Company is unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond amounts already accrued. As
a result, the Company may have exposure to additional tax liabilities that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results and financial
condition.

Other commitments

On May 8, 2025, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Deribit. Deribit is a crypto derivatives exchange, and the Company believes
this strategic acquisition will play a key role in its goal to be the premier global platform for crypto derivatives. The Company agreed to pay $700.0 million
cash and 10,997,881 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. The aggregate purchase price of cash and issuance of the Company’s Class A
common  stock  are  due  upon  the  closing  of  the  transaction,  which  is  subject  to  customary  closing  conditions,  including  regulatory  approvals,  and  is
expected  to  close  by  December  31,  2025.  In  the  interim,  the  aggregate  purchase  price  will  continue  to  fluctuate  with  changes  in  the  price  of  the
Company’s Class A common stock.

During the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company renewed a multi-year technology services agreement, committing $600.0 million in total
purchases over the next four years, including annual minimums ranging from $90.0 million to $130.0 million, consistent with historical commitment levels.
None of this commitment was accrued as of June 30, 2025.

17. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  Condensed
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  the  accompanying  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  and  our  Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2024  (the  “Annual  Report”).  The  following  discussion  and  analysis  contains  forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but
are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “Coinbase” refer to Coinbase
Global,  Inc.  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries.  For  all  narrative  provided  in  this  Item  2,  two  numbers  presented  consecutively  represent  figures  for  the
three and six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2024, respectively, unless otherwise noted.

Executive Overview

This executive overview of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations highlights selected information

and does not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

During  the  second  quarter  of  2025,  we  continued  to  make  progress  towards  our  mission  by  expanding  access  to  trading  through  innovative
derivative products, listing more spot assets, and expanding our offerings in markets globally. We also deepened financial utility with payment focused
innovations like Coinbase Business, USDC integration with Shopify, and the announcement of the Coinbase One Card. Infrastructure upgrades included
Base Chain’s decentralization milestones, faster transaction speeds, and expanded stablecoin distribution. During the second quarter, we also reached
significant  milestones  in  advancing  crypto  policy  and  regulation  both  domestically  and  internationally,  and  we  secured  our  Markets  in  Crypto-Assets
Regulation (“MiCA”) license.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, our net revenue was $1.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, including $764.3 million and $2.0
billion in transaction revenue and $655.8 million and $1.4 billion in subscription and services revenue. For the same periods in 2024, our net revenue
was  $1.4  billion  and  $3.0  billion,  respectively,  including  $780.9  million  and  $1.9  billion  in  transaction  revenue  and  $599.0  million  and  $1.1  billion  in
subscription and services revenue.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, our net income was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA was $512.1 million and

$1.4 billion. For the same periods in 2024, our net income was $36.2 million and $1.2 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA was $595.6 million and $1.6 billion.

Despite multiple Federal Funds Rate decreases in late 2024, future interest rate decreases are not certain. If interest rates continue to decline, they
may materially impact our subscription and services and other revenue. We plan to dynamically adjust our expense base in order to be responsive to
market  conditions  and  revenue  opportunities,  increasing  or  decreasing  it  as  needed,  especially  with  respect  to  certain  variable  expenses.  In  the  third
quarter  of  2025,  we  expect  technology  and  development  and  general  and  administrative  expenses  to  increase  as  compared  to  the  second  quarter  of
2025, driven by headcount growth. Additionally, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be in line with the second quarter of 2025, dependent on
USDC balances in Coinbase products and performance marketing opportunities throughout the quarter.

(1) MTUs for the three month period represent quarterly MTUs, which are calculated as the average of each month’s MTUs in each respective quarter. MTUs for the six month period are

calculated as the average of the quarterly MTUs within the period.

(3) See  the  section  titled  “Non-GAAP  Financial  Measure”  below  for  a  reconciliation  of  net  income  to Adjusted  EBITDA  and  an  explanation  for  why  we  consider Adjusted  EBITDA  to  be  a

helpful metric for investors.

Monthly Transacting Users

We define a Monthly Transacting User (“MTU”) as a consumer who actively or passively transacts in one or more products on our platform at least
once  during  the  rolling  28-day  period  ending  on  the  date  of  measurement.  MTUs  engage  in  transactions  that  generate  both  transaction  revenue  and
subscription  and  services  revenue.  Revenue-generating  transactions  include  active  transactions,  such  as  buying  or  selling  crypto  assets  or  passive
transactions  such  as  earning  staking  rewards  and  USDC  rewards.  MTUs  also  engage  in  transactions  that  are  non-revenue  generating,  such  as
consumers sending and receiving crypto assets between wallets and off-platform accounts on a non-expedited basis. MTUs may overstate the number
of unique consumers due to differences in product architecture or user behavior.

MTUs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to an increase in trading users, influenced by

overall crypto market sentiment and activity, including higher average prices for certain crypto assets.

Assets on Platform

We define Assets on Platform (“AOP”) as the total United States (“U.S.”) dollar equivalent value of USDC and crypto assets held or managed on
behalf of customers in digital wallets on our platform, including our custody services but excluding assets for which the customer holds full or partial keys,
calculated  based  on  the  market  price  on  the  date  of  measurement. AOP  demonstrates  the  scale  of  balances  held  across  our  suite  of  products  and
services,  the  trust  customers  place  in  us  to  securely  store  their  assets,  and  the  underlying  growth  of  the  cryptoeconomy.  AOP  also  represents  a
monetization  opportunity  through  our  products  and  services,  including  from  trading  and  the  adoption  and  use  of  USDC,  staking,  custody,  and  Prime
Financing, when customers use these assets to engage with these products and services.

Includes various other crypto asset balances, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total AOP.

AOP at June 30, 2025 increased as compared to June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting higher Bitcoin AOP, including $65.7 billion of growth attributable
to  units  and  $97.6  billion  of  growth  attributable  to  price.  Separately,  we  attribute  the  growth  in  USDC AOP  primarily  to  our  USDC  rewards  program,
combined with deeper integration of USDC across our products.

Trading Volume

We  define  Trading  Volume  as  the  total  U.S.  dollar  equivalent  value  of  spot  matched  trades  transacted  between  a  buyer  and  seller  through  our
platform  during  the  period  of  measurement.  Trading  Volume  does  not  include  derivatives  volume  on  our  platform  or  trades  executed  on  third-party
venues. Trading  Volume  represents  the  product  of  the  quantity  of  assets  transacted  and  the  trade  price  at  the  time  the  transaction  was  executed. As
trading  activity  directly  impacts  transaction  revenue,  we  believe  this  measure  is  a  reflection  of  liquidity  on  our  order  books,  trading  health,  and  the
underlying  growth  of  the  cryptoeconomy.  Institutions  incur  lower  fees  per  transaction  than  consumers  and,  as  a  result,  the  impact  of  changes  in
consumer Trading Volume on transaction revenue is more pronounced than the impact of changes in institutional Trading Volume.

Generally,  Trading  Volume  on  our  platform  is  primarily  influenced  by  overall  market  dynamics,  namely  the  price  of  crypto  assets,  crypto  asset
volatility, and macroeconomic conditions, and by our share of total crypto market spot trading volume. In periods of high crypto asset prices and crypto
asset volatility, we have experienced correspondingly high levels of Trading Volume.

Table of Contents

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024, Trading Volume increased reflecting an increase in the total market and

changes in our market share in the U.S., where our business is concentrated:

•

Total market — Crypto Asset Volatility  increased 11% and 13% and average total crypto market capitalization increased 29% and 36%. These
two macro inputs have historically been highly correlated with Trading Volume and are typically influenced by overall crypto market sentiment,
activity in the crypto market, and changes in average crypto asset prices.

1

• Market share — For the three months ended comparative period, Trading Volume growth fell short of the 12% growth in overall U.S. spot market
trading  volume,  as  we  saw  a  decrease  in  market  share  resulting  primarily  from  lower  USDT  Trading  Volume  driven  by  an  intentional  pricing
change made in March as we evolved our stablecoin strategy. For the six months ended comparative period, our Trading Volume outpaced the
15% growth in the overall U.S. spot market trading volume as we were able to capture a larger portion of the trading activity during the three
months ended March 31, 2025.

 Crypto Asset Volatility represents our internal measure of crypto asset volatility in the market relative to prior periods. The volatility is based on intraday returns of a volume-weighted basket
of  all  assets  listed  on  our  trading  platform. These  returns  are  used  to  compute  the  basket’s  intraday  volatility  which  is  then  scaled  to  a  daily  window. These  daily  volatility  values  are  then
averaged over the applicable time period as needed.

Transaction revenue changed for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024, due to:

•

changes in consumer transaction revenue driven by:

◦

◦

an increase of $98.8 million and $465.4 million attributed to a 16% and 30% increase in consumer Trading Volume; offset by

a decrease of $113.7 million and $319.9 million attributed to a lower average blended fee rate, primarily due to changes in the mix of
Trading Volume from Simple to Advanced trading, as well as growth in Trading Volume from Coinbase One users; and

•

an increase in institutional transaction revenue for the six months ended comparative period primarily driven by:

◦

◦

◦

the impact of 14% growth in institutional Trading Volume; and

an increase of $13.8 million from derivatives trading on our international exchange reflecting growth in trading volume; offset in part by

a $22.2 million decrease due to a lower average blended fee rate resulting primarily from reduced fees at higher Trading Volumes; and

•

an increase in other transaction revenue primarily driven by higher revenue from instant transfer withdrawals.

The percentage of transaction revenue from trading on our platform by crypto asset was as follows:

Subscription and services revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024, reflecting:

•

increases in stablecoin revenue of:

◦

◦

◦

$98.1 million and $203.3 million due to higher average USDC balances held in Coinbase products , on which we earn the vast majority
of the interest on the associated reserves; and

2

$71.4 million and $139.3 million due to higher average USDC off-platform balances, on which we earn varying percentages depending
on where the USDC is held; offset in part by

a decrease of $77.3 million and $145.8 million due to lower average interest rates, which declined 97 and 96 basis points;

•

changes in blockchain rewards, primarily consisting of:

◦

◦

a decrease of $43.5 million and $23.0 million due to changes in average crypto asset prices; offset in part by

an increase of $14.8 million and $22.5 million due to higher staked balances;

•

•

lower interest and finance fee income, primarily reflecting a decrease of $15.2 million and $26.6 million in interest income on customer custodial
cash attributable to lower average earned interest rates, which declined 116 and 103 basis points; and

an increase in other subscription and services revenue, primarily due to growth of Coinbase One, reflecting a higher number of paid subscribers.

•

•

•

•

•

lower blockchain rewards fees, which moved with blockchain rewards revenue, in addition to the impact of adjustments to our fee structures;

higher transaction rebates and commissions, primarily reflecting an increase in rebates earned by institutional customers providing liquidity on
our international exchange, driven by growth in volume;

an  increase  in  payment  processing  fees  for  the  six  months  ended  comparative  period,  due  primarily  to  increased  volumes  of  transactions
processed;

an increase in transaction reversal losses primarily driven by higher transaction volume; and

a decrease in blockchain transaction fees within other, primarily due to lower average gas and asset prices for Ethereum.

Changes  in  (gains)  losses  on  crypto  assets  held  for  operations,  net  resulted  primarily  from  holding  these  assets  during  periods  of  increasing  and
decreasing crypto asset prices, respectively. Though both gross inflows and outflows of these assets were $0.6 billion and $0.9 billion during the three
and six months ended June 30, 2025, and $0.8 billion and $1.1 billion during the same periods in 2024, gains and losses on changes in the fair value of
the assets were limited as these assets are converted to cash or used for expenses nearly immediately after receipt.

Changes in (gains) losses on crypto assets held for investment, net during all periods presented resulted primarily from fair value remeasurement of
these assets, mainly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The impact of these changes in fair value expanded late in the first quarter and during the second quarter of
2025, as we actively increased our investment in these assets during these periods.

Other (income) expense, net changed for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024, due primarily to:

•

•

•

a gain on the fair value remeasurement of our investment in Circle Internet Group, Inc. following its initial public offering in June 2025;

gains on the fair value remeasurement of certain other crypto asset-denominated financial instruments; and

losses on the fair value remeasurement of loan receivables originated from our crypto assets held for investment portfolio for the three months
ended June 30, 2024, which did not recur in 2025.

For  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2025  as  compared  to  2024,  the  increase  in  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  was  primarily  due  to
higher  pretax  income,  and  lower  tax  benefits  from  stock-based  compensation.  For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2025  as  compared  to  2024,  the
increase in provision for (benefit from) income taxes was primarily due to higher pretax income, and lower tax benefits from stock-based compensation
and research and development credits, as well as a valuation allowance on non-U.S. losses for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBB”) was signed into law in the United States. The OBBB includes significant changes to U.S.
federal tax law, such as an elective deduction for domestic research and experimental expenditures, and changes to the tax rate on income from non-
U.S. sources and subsidiaries. We are evaluating the impact of the OBBB but do not expect it to have a material impact on our effective tax rate and net
deferred tax asset balance in 2025.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure, is useful
information to help investors evaluate our operating performance because it: enables investors to compare this measure and component adjustments to
similar information provided by peer companies and our past financial performance; provides additional

38

Table of Contents

company-specific  adjustments  for  certain  items  that  may  be  included  in  income  from  operations  but  that  we  do  not  consider  to  be  normal,  recurring,
operating expenses (or income) necessary to operate our business given our operations, revenue generating activities, business strategy, industry, and
regulatory  environment;  and  provides  investors  with  visibility  to  a  measure  management  uses  to  evaluate  our  ongoing  operations  and  for  internal
planning and forecasting purposes. For example:

• We  believe  it  is  useful  to  exclude  certain  non-cash  expenses,  such  as  depreciation  and  amortization  and  stock-based  compensation,  from
Adjusted  EBITDA  because  the  amounts  of  such  expenses  can  vary  significantly  from  period  to  period  and  may  not  directly  correlate  to  the
underlying performance of our business operations.

• We  believe  it  is  useful  to  exclude  certain  items  that  we  do  not  consider  to  be  normal,  recurring,  cash  operating  expenses  and  therefore,  not
reflective  of  our  ongoing  business  operations.  For  example,  we  exclude:  (i)  other  (income)  expense,  net,  as  the  income  and  expenses
recognized in this line item are not part of our core operating activities and are considered non-operating activities under GAAP, (ii) gains and
losses  on  crypto  assets  held  for  investment  because  such  investments  are  considered  primarily  long-term  holdings,  and  (iii)  losses  directly
related to the Data Theft Incident, including voluntary customer reimbursements, direct legal costs, and reward payments, if any, in connection
with the threat actor’s arrest and conviction. We do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets, and, as an operating company, our
investing activities in crypto are not part of our revenue generating activities, which are based on transactions on our platform and the sales of
subscriptions and services.

• We  believe  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  to  measure  a  company’s  operating  performance  without  regard  to  items  such  as  stock-based
compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, net, and provision for (benefit from)
income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which
assets were acquired.

Limitations of Adjusted EBITDA

We  believe  that  Adjusted  EBITDA  may  be  helpful  to  investors  for  the  reasons  noted  above.  However,  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  presented  for
supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial
information presented in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the
nearest GAAP equivalent of Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA excludes:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

provision for (benefit from) income taxes;

interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us;

depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be
replaced in the future;

stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our
business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

losses directly related to the Data Theft Incident;

net gains or losses on our crypto assets held for investment; and

other  (income)  expense,  net,  which  represents  net  gains  or  losses  on  strategic  investments  and  other  financial  instruments,  and  other  non-
operating income and expense activity.

In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or may use other measures to evaluate

their performance, all of which could reduce the

39

Table of Contents

usefulness  of  our  disclosure  of Adjusted  EBITDA  as  a  tool  for  comparison. A  reconciliation  is  provided  below  for Adjusted  EBITDA  to  net  income,  the
most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measure
and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

There have been no material changes to our liquidity and capital resources from those presented in the Annual Report, other than those described

below.

We continue to believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and USDC will be sufficient in both the short and long term to meet our requirements
and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Our ability to meet our requirements and plans for cash,
including meeting our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of crypto assets
and blockchain technology, our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our products and
services, the introduction of new subscription products and services on our platform, expansion of sales and marketing activities, and overall economic
conditions. We anticipate satisfying both our short-term and long-term cash requirements with our existing cash and cash equivalents and USDC and
with future cash flows from operations, and potential future equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our
stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide
for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.

Long-term debt and other contractual obligations

There have been no material changes in our long-term debt since those presented in the Annual Report, except for the reclassification of our 2026
Convertible  Notes  due  on  June  1,  2026  from  non-current  liability  to  current  liability. As  of  June  30,  2025,  our  primary  contractual  obligation  remained
long-term  debt,  of  which  we  held  $4.3  billion  in  aggregate  principal  amount,  including  $1.3  billion  due  within  the  next  12  months  and  classified  as  a
current liability.

Our  other  contractual  obligations  increased  materially  over  those  as  of  December  31,  2024,  primarily  due  to  entry  into  office  lease,  multi-year
contract  renewal,  and  business  combination  agreements.  These  obligations  arise  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  represent  a  material  cash
requirement.  See  Note  10.  Other  Condensed  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  Details,  for  additional  details  on  leases,  and  Note  16.  Commitments  and
Contingencies, for additional details on non-cancelable purchase obligations and the business combination, of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Crypto assets

We  hold  and  use  crypto  assets  for  various  purposes.  Crypto  assets  held  for  operations  are  received  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  and  are
converted  to  cash  or  used  to  fulfill  expenses,  primarily  blockchain  rewards,  nearly  immediately.  In  order  to  facilitate  Prime  Financing,  we  hold  crypto
assets we borrow, as well as crypto assets customers pledge as collateral against certain of our loans to them. We do not use these assets as a source
of liquidity otherwise. Crypto assets held for investment are primarily long-term holdings and in certain cases fulfill capital requirements set by regulators
(see also Capital requirements below). We do not plan to engage in regular trading of these crypto assets but may purchase additional crypto assets for
investment as a buy and hold strategy. In case of a liquidity stress event, or for other episodic purposes, which may necessitate the use of these assets,
we may change our policy and sell crypto assets held for investment to generate liquidity. During times of instability in the crypto assets market, we may
not be able to sell our crypto assets at reasonable prices or at all. Our

41

Table of Contents

crypto assets held are considered less liquid than our cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same
extent as cash and cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2025, we held the following crypto assets: $126.0 million held for operations, $951.3 million held as
collateral, $223.6 million that were borrowed, and $1.8 billion held for investment.

Customer assets and liabilities

Recognized  customer  assets  and  liabilities  comprise  customer  custodial  funds  and  corresponding  customer  custodial  liabilities  that  represent  our
obligation  to  return  these  assets  to  the  customers.  We  also  securely  store  additional  customer  AOP  that  we  do  not  recognize  in  our  Condensed
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  We  do  not  use  customer  crypto  assets  as  collateral  for  any  loan,  margin,  rehypothecation,  or  other  similar  activities  to
which we or our affiliates are a party, without the customer’s consent.

Our business model does not expose us to liquidity risk if we have excessive redemptions or withdrawals from customers. As of June 30, 2025, we

have not experienced excessive redemptions or withdrawals, or prolonged suspended redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets to date.

Capital requirements

Although  currently  we  are  not  supervised  by  any  federal  banking  agency,  and  our  trading  platform  is  not  an  SEC-regulated  national  securities
exchange or alternative trading system, we operate globally in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment and are subject to a wide range of
laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal, state, and local and foreign governments and regulatory authorities. These rules and regulations govern
how we manage our liquidity, operations, and capital structure. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries hold licenses to operate as trust companies, money
transmitters,  and  derivatives  exchanges,  or  equivalents,  requiring  compliance  with  strict  safeguards  for  customer  funds  and  crypto  assets,  as  well  as
capital and net worth requirements. For more information, see Part I, Item 1. “Business–Government Regulations” in the Annual Report as well as Part II,
Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In certain jurisdictions, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law, at a level
equal  to  at  least  100%  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  all  customer  custodial  fund  liabilities.  Eligible  liquid  assets  can  include  cash,  cash  equivalents,
customer custodial funds, and in-transit customer receivables. As of June 30, 2025 our eligible liquid assets were greater than the aggregate amount of
customer custodial fund liabilities.

Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of USDC and crypto asset
transactions, as well as USDC and crypto assets under custody. As of June 30, 2025, in aggregate, these subsidiaries were compliant with associated
capital requirements of approximately $1.3 billion, which were met by a combination of corporate cash and cash equivalents and certain crypto assets
held.

Our  largest  source  of  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  are  revenues  generated  from  transaction  fees.  Our  primary  uses  of  cash  in  operating

activities include payments to employees for compensation, website hosting and infrastructure services, and professional services.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $749.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily due to:

•

•

•

•

a $454.8 million increase in cash used to purchase USDC, reflecting higher customer demand;

$253.4 million in cash used in 2025 related to the Data Theft Incident, for which impacted customers were voluntarily reimbursed; and

an overall increase in other cash expenses as we continue to grow our business; offset in part by

cash provided as a result of the $444.3 million increase in total revenue.

Investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $772.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024 as we invested more

of our available cash, including:

•

•

a $448.7 million increase in cash used for net purchases of crypto assets held for investment; and

a $205.9 million increase in cash used for the origination of fiat loans, net of repayments, reflecting higher demand for Prime Financing products.

Financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities increased by $2.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily due to:

•

•

a $1.1 billion net decrease in cash provided as the prior year included proceeds from the issuance of our 2030 Convertible Notes less cash paid
for associated capped calls; and

a $783.2 million decrease in customer custodial funds, as we saw an increase in average customer USDC balances held in Coinbase products,
which offer a higher yield.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures.

43

Table of Contents

We  base  our  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances. Actual
results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial
statement presentation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows will be affected.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in the Annual

Report.

Recent accounting pronouncements

See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and not yet adopted as of the date of this report.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements associated with the effect of changes in market factors, including risks
associated  with  interest  rates,  foreign  currency,  derivatives,  equity  investments,  and  crypto  assets.  These  assets,  liabilities,  and  equities  are  held  for
purposes  other  than  trading.  There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  our  market  risk  exposures  from  the  information  presented  in  Part  II,  Item  7A.
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 except for our
market risk exposure on our crypto assets held for investment and on our marketable equity securities held within strategic investments.

Market Risk of Crypto Assets

Though the nature of this exposure and the overall implied volatility of the crypto assets underlying this exposure have not changed since December

31, 2024, the number of units we hold and the price of the assets have changed, resulting in a material change in the result of our sensitivity analysis.

Crypto assets held for investment are primarily held long term, and historically, we have not attempted to reduce our market risk exposure associated
with  these  crypto  assets.  Crypto  asset  prices  have  been  volatile,  as  demonstrated  by  the  one  year  historical  volatility  of  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  of
approximately 50% implied from the annualized standard deviation of daily price returns observed in the past 24 months. A hypothetical 50% increase or
decrease in crypto assets prices as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 would result in a $919.4 million and $776.5 million impact, respectively, to
the  value  of  our  Crypto  assets  held  for  investment  and  would  have  been  recorded  as  gains  or  losses  in  our  Condensed  Consolidated  Statements  of
Operations. The increase in the hypothetical gains or losses since December 31, 2024 primarily reflects changes in the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum
and  an  increase  in  the  units  of  each  that  we  hold,  as  we  increased  our  investment  in  crypto  assets  during  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2025,
deploying available cash.

Equity Investment Risk

Marketable Equity Securities Risk

We  hold  marketable  equity  securities  measured  and  recorded  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis,  exposing  us  to  risk  that  the  fair  value  of  these
securities will decline due to changes in market prices. These marketable equity securities are considered strategic investments primarily held long term,
and we have not attempted to reduce our market risk exposure associated with these investments.

As  of  June  30,  2025,  our  strategic  investments  in  marketable  equity  securities  were  $1.6  billion.  No  marketable  equity  securities  were  held  as  of
December 31, 2024. Adjustments to the fair value of these investments are recorded in Other (income) expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, we recognized gains of $1.5 billion on

44

Table of Contents

strategic investments in marketable equity securities, driven primarily by the fair value remeasurement of our investment in Circle Internet Group, Inc.
following its initial public offering in June 2025.

Changes in market prices of our strategic investments could materially impact our future results of operations and cash flows, the impact of which is
difficult to predict as it depends on market factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy, including due to lack of extended price history for our
largest holding as the entity recently entered the public market, and its high price volatility since public debut. In addition, this holding, which comprises
nearly  all  of  our  marketable  equity  securities  balance  at  June  30,  2025,  is  subject  to  standard  post-initial  public  offering  restrictions  as  to  disposition,
limiting our flexibility to change strategy with respect to this holding based on changes in market conditions or other circumstances. The restriction ends
on the earlier of (i) the date that is the second trading day after the entity publicly announces its earnings for the quarter ending September 30, 2025 and
(ii) December 1, 2025. If an adverse 10% fair value remeasurement was applied to our strategic investment marketable equity security holdings as of
June 30, 2025, it would result in a $155.4 million loss within Other (income) expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in  SEC  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer
(our principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2025. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as
of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of
judgment  in  designing,  implementing,  operating,  and  evaluating  the  controls  and  procedures,  and  the  inability  to  eliminate  misconduct  completely.
Accordingly,  in  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  management  recognizes  that  any  system  of  internal  control  over
financial  reporting,  including  ours,  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated,  can  only  provide  reasonable,  not  absolute  assurance  of  achieving  the
desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate.  We  intend  to  continue  to  monitor  and  upgrade  our  internal  controls  as
necessary or appropriate for our

45

Table of Contents

business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

For  a  description  of  material  legal  proceedings  in  which  we  are  involved,  see  Note  16.  Commitments  and  Contingencies  of  the  Notes  to  our
Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Part  I,  Item  1  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q,  which  is  incorporated  herein  by
reference.

We are not presently a party to any other legal or regulatory proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would
individually  or  taken  together  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results,  financial  condition,  or  cash  flows.  However,  we  are
subject to regulatory oversight by numerous state, federal, and foreign regulators and we are and we may become subject to various legal proceedings,
inquiries, investigations, and demand letters that arise in the course of our business. For example, we have received investigative subpoenas and other
inquiries from various state agencies and attorneys general for documents and information pertaining to our business practices and policies, customer
complaints, asset launches, certain ongoing litigation, and certain transfers of crypto assets. In addition, we have received investigative subpoenas from
the SEC and similar subpoenas and demand letters from various regulators for documents and information, including about certain customer programs,
operations, and existing and intended future products, including our processes for listing assets, the classification of certain listed assets, our staking
programs, and our stablecoin and yield-generating products. We intend to cooperate fully with such investigations. These examples are not exhaustive.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investing  in  our  Class A  common  stock  involves  a  high  degree  of  risk. You  should  carefully  consider  the  risks  and  uncertainties  described  below,
together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become
important  factors  that  adversely  affect  our  business.  If  any  of  the  following  risks  occur,  our  business,  operating  results,  financial  condition,  and  future
prospects  could  be  materially  and  adversely  affected.  Many  risks  affect  more  than  one  category,  and  the  risks  are not in order of  significance  or
probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. The market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could
lose part or all of your investment due to any of these risks.

The Most Material Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position

Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto.

Due  to  the  highly  volatile  nature  of  the  cryptoeconomy  and  the  prices  of  crypto  assets,  our  operating  results  have,  and  will  continue  to,  fluctuate
significantly  from  quarter  to  quarter  in  accordance  with  market  sentiments  and  movements  in  the  broader  cryptoeconomy.  Our  operating  results  will
continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are unpredictable and in certain instances are outside of our control,
including:

•

•

crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for crypto assets, which can be highly volatile;

our ability to attract, maintain, grow, and engage our customer and developer base;

46

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, or actions by U.S. or foreign governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent
decrees;

regulatory changes or scrutiny that impact our ability to offer certain products or services;

our ability to continue to diversify and grow our subscription and services revenue;

our mix of revenue between transaction and subscription and services;

pricing for, or temporary suspensions of, our products and services;

adding crypto assets to, or removing from, our platform;

our ability to establish and maintain partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties;

fluctuations in the market values of our strategic investments;

• market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, the cryptoeconomy;

• macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, changes in tariffs and trade restrictions, and instability in the global banking system;

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

adverse  legal  proceedings  or  regulatory  enforcement  actions,  judgments,  settlements,  or  other  legal  proceedings,  and  enforcement-related
costs;

the development and introduction of existing and new products and services by us or our competitors;

the  amount  and  timing  of  our  operating  expenses  related  to  the  maintenance  and  expansion  of  our  business  and  operations,  including
investments we make in the development of products and services, as well as technology offered to our developers, international expansion, and
sales and marketing;

system failures, outages or interruptions, including with respect to our platform and third-party crypto networks;

our  lack  of  control  over  decentralized  or  third-party  blockchains  and  networks  that  may  experience  downtime,  cyberattacks,  critical  failures,
errors, bugs, corrupted files, data losses, or other similar software failures, outages, breaches and losses;

breaches of security or privacy;

inaccessibility of our platform due to our or third-party actions;

our ability to attract and retain talent; and

our ability to compete with our competitors.

As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast growth trends accurately and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate,
particularly in the short term. In particular, our subscription and services revenue has grown over time, with stablecoin revenue received in connection
with USDC becoming a more meaningful revenue contributor. Therefore, our operating results could fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the
demand for our subscription and service offerings, in the demand for USDC, in the mix of USDC balances held in Coinbase products as compared to
that held off-platform, in interest rates, and to our ongoing relationships with third parties, such as Circle.

In  view  of  the  rapidly  evolving  nature  of  our  business  and  the  cryptoeconomy,  period-to-period  comparisons  of  our  operating  results  may  not  be
meaningful,  and  you  should  not  rely  upon  them  as  an  indication  of  future  performance.  Quarterly  and  annual  expenses  reflected  in  our  financial
statements  may  be  significantly  different  from  historical  or  projected  rates.  Our  operating  results  in  one  or  more  future  quarters  may  fall  below  the
expectations of securities analysts and investors. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock may increase or decrease significantly.

Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform. If such
price or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected and the price of our Class A
common stock could decline.

We generate a large portion of our total revenue from transaction fees on our platform in connection with the purchase, sale, and trading of crypto
assets by our customers. Transaction revenue is based on transaction fees that are either a flat fee or a percentage of the value of each transaction. For
our consumer trading product, we also charge a spread to ensure that we are able to settle purchases and sales at the prices we quote to customers.
We also generate a large portion of total revenue from our subscription and services, and such revenue has grown over time, primarily due to growth in
stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC. Declines in the volume of crypto asset transactions, the price of crypto assets, or market liquidity for crypto
assets generally may result in lower total revenue to us.

The price of crypto assets and associated demand for buying, selling, and trading crypto assets have historically been subject to significant volatility.
If  the  price  and  transaction  volume  of  crypto  assets  decline  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  generate  revenue  may  suffer  and  customer  demand  for  our
products and services may decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the price of our Class
A  common  stock  to  decline.  The  price  and  transaction  volume  of  any  crypto  asset  is  subject  to  significant  uncertainty  and  volatility,  depending  on  a
number of factors, including:

• market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, crypto assets and the cryptoeconomy, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions

taken by or developments of other companies in the cryptoeconomy;

changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities;

trading activities on other crypto platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative activities;

investment and trading activities of highly active consumer and institutional users, speculators, miners, and investors;

the  speed  and  rate  at  which  crypto  is  able  to  gain  adoption  as  a  medium  of  exchange,  utility,  store  of  value,  consumptive  asset,  security
instrument, or other financial assets worldwide, if at all;

decreased user and investor confidence in crypto assets and crypto platforms;

negative publicity and events relating to the cryptoeconomy;

unpredictable social media coverage or “trending” of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding, crypto assets;

the ability for crypto assets to meet user and investor demands;

the functionality and utility of crypto assets and their associated ecosystems and networks, including crypto assets designed for use in various
applications;

consumer preferences and perceived value of crypto assets and crypto asset markets;

increased  competition  from  other  payment  services  or  other  crypto  assets  that  may  exhibit  better  speed,  security,  scalability,  or  other
characteristics;

adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, or settlements impacting cryptoeconomy participants;

regulatory or legislative changes, scrutiny and updates affecting the cryptoeconomy;

the characterization of crypto assets under the laws of various jurisdictions around the world;

the adoption of unfavorable taxation policies on crypto asset investments by governmental entities;

the  maintenance,  troubleshooting,  and  development  of  the  blockchain  networks  underlying  crypto  assets,  including  by  miners,  validators,  and
developers worldwide;

the ability for crypto networks to attract and retain miners or validators to secure and confirm transactions accurately and efficiently;

legal and regulatory changes affecting the operations of miners and validators of blockchain networks, including limitations, and prohibitions on
mining activities, or new legislative or regulatory requirements as a result of growing environmental concerns around the use of energy in Bitcoin
and other proof-of-work mining activities;

ongoing  technological  viability  and  security  of  crypto  assets  and  their  associated  smart  contracts,  applications  and  networks,  including
vulnerabilities against hacks and scalability;

speed and fees associated with processing crypto asset transactions, including on the underlying blockchain networks and on crypto platforms;

financial strength of market participants;

the availability and cost of funding and capital;

the liquidity and credit risk of other crypto platforms and other participants of the cryptoeconomy;

interruptions or temporary suspensions or other compulsory restrictions in products or services from or failures of major crypto platforms;

availability of an active derivatives market for various crypto assets;

availability of banking and payment services to support crypto-related projects;

instability in the global banking system and the level of interest rates and inflation;

• monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, and fiat currency devaluations; and

•

national and international economic and political conditions.

There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event
that  the  price  of  crypto  assets  or  the  demand  for  trading  crypto  assets  decline,  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition  would  be
adversely affected and the price of our Class A common stock could decline.

Our net revenue may be concentrated in a limited number of areas. Within transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue, a
meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and stablecoin revenue in connection with USDC, respectively. If
revenue from these areas declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets or other products and services, our business,
operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

While we support a diverse portfolio of crypto assets for trading, staking and custody, our net revenue is concentrated in a limited number of areas,
such  as  transactions  in  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  for  transaction  revenue  and  stablecoin  revenue  in  connection  with  USDC  for  subscription  and  services
revenue. For the six months ended June 30, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024, we derived a meaningful amount of our net revenue from
transaction fees generated in connection with the trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum; these trading pairs drove approximately 41% and 44% of total Trading
Volume on our platform during these periods, respectively. In addition to the factors impacting the broader cryptoeconomy

49

Table of Contents

described in this section, our revenue may be adversely affected if the markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum deteriorate or if their prices decline, including as
a result of the following factors:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the reduction in blockchain transaction fees of Bitcoin, including block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific period
of time and reduce the block reward earned by miners;

public  sentiment  related  to  the  actual  or  perceived  environmental  impact  of  Bitcoin,  Ethereum,  and  related  activities,  including  environmental
concerns raised by private individuals and governmental actors related to the energy resources consumed in the Bitcoin mining process;

disruptions, hacks, splits in the underlying networks also known as “forks,” attacks by malicious actors who control a significant portion of the
networks’ hash rate such as double spend or 51% attacks, or other similar incidents affecting the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain networks;

hard “forks” resulting in the creation of and divergence into multiple separate networks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic;

informal governance led by Bitcoin and Ethereum’s core developers that lead to revisions to the underlying source code or inactions that prevent
network scaling, and which evolve over time largely based on self-determined participation, which may result in new changes or updates that
affect their speed, security, usability, or value;

the  ability  for  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  blockchain  networks  to  resolve  significant  scaling  challenges  and  increase  the  volume  and  speed  of
transactions;

the ability to attract and retain customers and developers to use Bitcoin and Ethereum for payment, store of value, unit of accounting, and other
intended uses and the absence of another supported crypto asset to attract and retain developers and customers for the same;

transaction  congestion  and  fees  associated  with  processing  transactions  on  the  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  networks  and  the  absence  of  another
supported crypto asset to replace these transactions;

the identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s Bitcoins;

negative perception of Bitcoin or Ethereum;

developments in mathematics and technology, including in digital computing, algebraic geometry, and quantum computing that could result in the
cryptography being used by Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming insecure or ineffective;

adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, or settlements impacting cryptoeconomy participants;

regulatory, legislative or other compulsory or informal restrictions or limitations on Bitcoin or Ethereum lending, mining or staking activities;

liquidity and credit risk issues experienced by other crypto platforms and other participants of the cryptoeconomy; and

laws and regulations affecting the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks or access to these networks, including a determination that either Bitcoin or
Ethereum constitutes a controlled or otherwise regulated financial instrument under the laws of any jurisdiction.

Our  subscription  and  services  revenue  has  grown  over  time  to  represent  a  more  meaningful  amount  of  our  revenue,  primarily  due  to  growth  in
stablecoin revenue received in connection with USDC. Such revenue depends on a variety of factors, including demand for our subscription and services
offerings, demand for USDC, the overall USDC market capitalization, the mix of USDC balances held in Coinbase products as compared to that held off-
platform, interest rates, and our ongoing relationships with third

50

Table of Contents

parties, such as Circle. If such factors are negatively impacted, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances with third parties. If we
are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining strategic relationships with these third parties or if these third parties fail to deliver certain
operational services, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We  have  in  the  past,  and  may  in  the  future,  enter  into  partnerships,  collaborations,  joint  ventures,  or  strategic  alliances  with  third  parties  in
connection  with  the  development,  operation,  and  enhancement  of  our  platform  and  products  and  the  provision  of  our  services.  For  example,  Circle
provides us with creation and redemption services for USDC, including the operational capabilities required for our USDC customer-facing services. If
Circle  fails  to  provide  certain  operational  services,  our  ability  to  maintain  our  current  level  of  offerings  and  customer  experience  for  USDC  could  be
harmed  and  interest  or  confidence  in  USDC  could  be  impacted.  Identifying  strategic  relationships  with  third  parties  and  negotiating  and  documenting
relationships  with  them  may  be  time-consuming  and  complex  and  may  distract  management.  Moreover,  we  may  be  delayed,  or  not  be  successful,  in
achieving  the  objectives  that  we  anticipate  as  a  result  of  such  strategic  relationships.  In  evaluating  counterparties  in  connection  with  partnerships,
collaborations, joint ventures or strategic alliances, we consider a wide range of economic, legal and regulatory criteria depending on the nature of such
relationship, including the counterparties’ reputation, operating results and financial condition, operational ability to satisfy our and our customers’ needs
in a timely manner, efficiency and reliability of systems, certifications costs to us or to our customers, and licensure and compliance status. Despite this
evaluation,  third  parties  may  still  not  meet  our  or  our  customers’  needs  which  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  deliver  products  and  services  to
customers,  and  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Counterparties  to  any  strategic  relationship  may  have
economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may subject us to additional
risks to the extent any such third party becomes the subject of negative publicity, faces its own litigation or regulatory challenges, or faces other adverse
circumstances. Conflicts may arise with our strategic partners, such as the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, which may result in
litigation  or  arbitration  which  would  increase  our  expenses  and  divert  the  attention  of  our  management.  If  we  are  unsuccessful  in  establishing  or
maintaining  strategic  relationships  with  third  parties,  our  ability  to  compete  in  the  marketplace  or  to  grow  our  revenue  could  be  impaired  and  our
business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Interest rate fluctuations could negatively impact us.

The  level  of  prevailing  short-term  interest  rates  affects  our  profitability  because  we  derive  a  large  portion  of  our  revenue  from  interest  earned  on
funds deposited with us by our customers which we hold on their behalf in custodial accounts at financial institutions and from stablecoin revenue, which
is derived from interest earned on USDC reserve balances, as well as from interest earned on corporate cash and cash equivalents. Higher interest rates
increase the amount of interest and finance fee income and stablecoin revenue earned from these activities. When short-term interest rates decline, our
revenue  derived  from  interest  correspondingly  declines.  Further,  because  stablecoin  revenue  from  USDC  has  become  an  increased  portion  of  our
subscription  and  services  revenue,  if  interest  rates  were  to  significantly  decline  from  levels  reached  in  the  current  interest  rate  environment,  our  net
revenue could decline. Conversely, when interest rates increase, investors may choose to shift their asset allocations, which could negatively impact our
stock price or the cryptoeconomy more generally.

The future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If crypto does not grow
as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Crypto  assets  built  on  blockchain  technology  were  only  introduced  in  2008  and  remain  in  the  early  stages  of  development.  In  addition,  different
crypto assets are designed for different purposes. Bitcoin, for instance, was designed to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, while Ethereum
was  designed  to  be  a  smart  contract  and  decentralized  application  platform.  Many  other  crypto  networks,  ranging  from  cloud  computing  to  tokenized
securities networks, have only recently been established. The further growth and development of any crypto assets and their underlying networks and
other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the creation, transfer, and usage of crypto assets represent a new and evolving paradigm that is
subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, including:

• many  crypto  networks  have  limited  operating  histories,  have  not  been  validated  in  production,  and  are  still  in  the  process  of  developing  and
making  significant  decisions  that  will  affect  the  design,  supply,  issuance,  functionality,  and  governance  of  their  respective  crypto  assets  and
underlying blockchain networks, any of which could adversely affect their respective crypto assets;

• many crypto networks are in the process of implementing software upgrades and other changes to their protocols, which could introduce bugs,

security risks, or adversely affect the respective crypto networks;

•

•

•

•

•

•

several  large  networks,  including  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum,  are  developing  new  features  to  address  fundamental  speed,  scalability,  and  energy
usage issues. If these issues are not successfully addressed, or if these networks do not achieve widespread adoption, it could adversely affect
the underlying crypto assets;

security issues, bugs, and software errors have been identified with many crypto assets and their underlying blockchain networks, some of which
have been exploited by malicious actors. There are also inherent security weaknesses in some crypto assets, such as when creators of certain
crypto networks use procedures that could allow hackers to counterfeit tokens. Any weaknesses identified with a crypto asset could adversely
affect  its  price,  security,  liquidity,  and  adoption  rate.  If  one  or  more  malicious  actors  obtains  a  majority  of  the  compute  or  staking  power  on  a
crypto network, as has happened in the past, it may be able to engage in illicit activity, which could cause financial losses to holders, damage the
network’s reputation and security, and adversely affect its value;

the development of new technologies for mining, such as improved application-specific integrated circuits (commonly referred to as ASICs), or
changes in industry patterns, such as the consolidation of mining power in a small number of large mining farms, could reduce the security of
blockchain networks, lead to increased liquid supply of crypto assets, and reduce a crypto asset’s price and attractiveness;

if rewards and transaction fees for miners or validators on any particular crypto network are not sufficiently high to attract and retain miners or
validators, a crypto network’s security and speed may be adversely affected, increasing the likelihood of a malicious attack;

crypto networks may have consolidated points of failure (such as concentrated ownership or an “admin key”), allowing a small group of holders
to  have  significant  unilateral  control  and  influence  over  key  decisions  related  to  their  crypto  networks,  such  as  governance  decisions  and
protocol changes, as well as the market price of such crypto assets;

the governance of many decentralized blockchain networks, including L2 blockchains like Base Chain (formerly Base), is by voluntary consensus
and open competition, and many developers are not directly compensated for their contributions. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus
or clarity on the governance of any particular crypto network, a lack of incentives for developers to maintain or develop the network, and other
unforeseen issues, any of which could result in

52

Table of Contents

unexpected or undesirable errors, bugs, or changes, or stymie such network’s utility and ability to respond to challenges and grow; and

• many crypto networks are in the early stages of developing partnerships and collaborations, any or all of which may not succeed and adversely

affect the usability and adoption of the respective crypto assets.

Various  other  technical  issues  have  also  been  uncovered  from  time  to  time  that  resulted  in  disabled  functionalities,  exposure  of  certain  users’
personal information, theft of users’ assets, and other negative consequences, and which required resolution with the attention and efforts of their global
miner, user, and development communities. If any such risks or other risks materialize, and in particular if they are not resolved, the development and
growth of crypto may be significantly affected and, as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Cyberattacks and security breaches of our platform, or those impacting our customers or third parties, could adversely affect our brand,
reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of confidential information, customer, employee, service provider, and
other  personal  data,  as  well  as  information  required  to  access  customer  assets.  We  have  built  our  reputation  on  the  premise  that  our  platform  offers
customers a secure way to purchase, store, and transact in crypto assets. As a result, any actual or perceived security breach of us or our third-party
partners may:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

harm our reputation and brand;

result in our systems or services being unavailable and interrupt our operations;

result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and data protection laws;

result in significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties, and other legal, regulatory, and financial exposure;

cause us to incur significant remediation costs;

lead to theft or irretrievable loss of our or our customers’ fiat currencies or crypto assets;

reduce customer confidence in, or decrease customer use of, our products and services;

divert the attention of management from the operation of our business;

result in significant compensation or contractual penalties payable by us to our customers or third parties as a result of losses to them or claims
by them; and

adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

For  example,  as  previously  disclosed  on  a  Current  Report  on  Form  8-K  filed  with  the  SEC  on  May  15,  2025,  a  threat  actor  improperly  obtained
information  about  certain  customer  accounts  and  internal  documentation,  and  used  that  information  for  social-engineering  attempts.  No  passwords  or
private keys were compromised as a result of this incident. Our investigation of this incident remains ongoing and we continue to face risks related to this
incident, including harm to our reputation, governmental investigations and regulatory scrutiny, and ongoing litigation.

Further,  any  actual  or  perceived  breach  or  cybersecurity  attack  directed  at  other  financial  institutions  or  crypto  companies,  whether  or  not  we  are
directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in the cryptoeconomy or in the use of technology to conduct financial transactions,
which could negatively impact us, including the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and technology infrastructure.

An  increasing  number  of  organizations,  including  large  merchants,  businesses,  technology  companies,  and  financial  institutions,  as  well  as
government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted
attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.

Attacks upon systems across a variety of industries, including the crypto industry, are increasing in their frequency, persistence, and sophistication,
and, in many cases, are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded, and organized groups and individuals, including state actors. The techniques
used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data and crypto assets), disable or
degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they
have been launched against a target. These attacks may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners. Certain types of
cyberattacks could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed. For example, attacks may be designed to deceive employees and service providers
into releasing control of our systems to a hacker, while others may aim to introduce computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to stealing
confidential or proprietary data. Additionally, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable until launched against a target, and we may
not be able to implement adequate preventative measures.

Although  we  have  developed  systems  and  processes  designed  to  protect  the  data  we  manage,  prevent  data  loss  and  other  security  breaches,
effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no
assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks. We have experienced from time to time, and may
experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other
irregularities. Unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems and facilities, as well
as  those  of  our  customers,  partners,  and  third-party  service  providers,  through  various  means,  including  hacking,  social  engineering,  phishing,  and
attempting  to  fraudulently  induce  individuals  (including  employees,  service  providers,  and  our  customers)  into  disclosing  usernames,  passwords,
payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems and customers’ crypto
assets.  Threats  can  come  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  criminal  hackers,  hacktivists,  state-sponsored  intrusions,  industrial  espionage,  and
insiders. Certain threat actors may be supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult
to detect. We may also acquire other companies that expose us to unexpected security risks or increase costs to improve the security posture of the
acquired  company.  Further,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  such  threat  actor  activities  as  a  result  of  the  increased  prevalence  of  hybrid  and  remote
working  arrangements  in  recent  years.  As  a  result,  our  costs  and  the  resources  we  devote  to  protecting  against  these  advanced  threats  and  their
consequences may continue to increase over time.

Although  we  maintain  insurance  coverage,  it  may  be  insufficient  to  protect  us  against  all  losses  and  costs  stemming  from  security  breaches,
cyberattacks, and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions or data theft and loss from such events. Outages and disruptions of our
platform, including any caused by cyberattacks, may harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are subject to an extensive, highly-evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with,
any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our  business  is  subject  to  extensive  laws,  rules,  regulations,  policies,  orders,  determinations,  directives,  treaties,  and  legal  and  regulatory
interpretations  and  guidance  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate,  including  those  governing  financial  services  and  banking,  federal  government
contractors,  trust  companies,  securities,  derivative  transactions  and  markets,  broker-dealers  and  alternative  trading  systems  (“ATS”),  commodities,
credit, crypto asset custody, exchange, and transfer, cross-border and

54

Table of Contents

domestic  money  and  crypto  asset  transmission,  commercial  lending,  usury,  foreign  currency  exchange,  privacy,  data  governance,  data  protection,
cybersecurity, fraud detection, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, escheatment, antitrust
and competition, bankruptcy, tax, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. Many of these legal
and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) and
related technologies. As a result, some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the cryptoeconomy,
are  subject  to  significant  uncertainty,  and  vary  widely  across  U.S.  federal,  state,  and  local  and  international  jurisdictions.  These  legal  and  regulatory
regimes,  including  the  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  thereunder,  evolve  frequently  and  may  be  modified,  interpreted,  and  applied  in  an  inconsistent
manner  from  one  jurisdiction  to  another,  and  may  conflict  with  one  another.  Moreover,  the  complexity  and  evolving  nature  of  our  business  and  the
significant  uncertainty  surrounding  the  regulation  of  the  cryptoeconomy  requires  us  to  exercise  our  judgment  as  to  whether  certain  laws,  rules,  and
regulations  apply  to  us,  and  it  is  possible  that  governmental  bodies  and  regulators  may  disagree  with  our  conclusions.  To  the  extent  we  have  not
complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on or temporary or permanent
suspensions of our products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Additionally, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including legislative and executive bodies, in the United States and in other countries may
adopt new laws and regulations, the direction and timing of which may be influenced by changes in the governing administrations and major events in
the cryptoeconomy. For example, following the failure of several prominent crypto trading venues and lending platforms, such as FTX, Celsius Networks,
Voyager  and  Three  Arrows  Capital  in  2022  (the  “2022  Events”),  the  U.S.  Congress  expressed  the  need  for  both  greater  federal  oversight  of  the
cryptoeconomy and comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation.

Governmental and regulatory bodies, including in the United States, may introduce new policies, laws, and regulations relating to crypto assets and
the  cryptoeconomy  generally,  and  crypto  asset  platforms  in  particular.  Other  companies’  failures  of  risk  management  and  other  control  functions,
including  those  that  played  a  role  in  the  2022  Events,  could  contribute  to  stricter  oversight  of  crypto  asset  platforms  and  the  cryptoeconomy.
Furthermore,  new  interpretations  of  existing  laws  and  regulations  may  be  issued  by  such  bodies  or  the  judiciary,  which  may  adversely  impact  the
development  of  the  cryptoeconomy  as  a  whole  and  our  legal  and  regulatory  status  in  particular  by  changing  how  we  operate  our  business,  how  our
products  and  services  are  regulated,  and  what  products  or  services  we  and  our  competitors  can  offer,  requiring  changes  to  our  compliance  and  risk
mitigation  measures,  imposing  new  licensing  requirements,  or  imposing  a  total  ban  on  certain  crypto  asset  transactions,  as  has  occurred  in  certain
jurisdictions  in  the  past.  In  November  2023,  the  New York  Department  of  Financial  Services  (“NYDFS”)  adopted  guidance  regarding  the  policies  and
procedures  required  for  virtual  currency  business  entities  licensed  in  New York,  such  as  Coinbase,  Inc. This  guidance  and  other  applicable  state  law
guidance regarding virtual currency business activity could result in changes to our business in such states as well as the risk of increased operational
costs and the risk of enforcement actions. If we are unable to comply with any new requirements, our ability to offer our products and services in their
current  form  may  be  adversely  affected.  Additionally,  under  recommendations  from  the  Financial  Crimes  Enforcement  Network  (“FinCEN”),  and  the
Financial Action Task Force, the United States and several foreign jurisdictions have or are likely to impose the Funds Transfer Rule (commonly referred
to as the Travel Rule) on financial service providers in the cryptoeconomy. We may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with the Travel
Rule  and  may  be  further  subject  to  administrative  sanctions  for  technical  violations  or  customer  attrition  if  the  user  experience  suffers  as  a  result.  In
October 2023, FinCEN released a proposed rule that identifies virtual currency “mixing” as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern
and  imposes  heightened  recordkeeping  and  reporting  obligations  for  financial  institutions  with  respect  to  those  transactions.  There  are  substantial
uncertainties regarding the

55

Table of Contents

scope of these requirements in practice, and we may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with these rules.

Moreover,  we  offer  and  may  in  the  future  offer  products  and  services  whose  functionality  or  value  depends  in  part  on  our  management  of  token
transaction  smart  contracts,  liquid  staking,  asset  tracking,  or  other  applications  that  provide  novel  forms  of  customer  engagement  and  interaction
delivered via blockchain protocols. We may also offer products and services whose functionality or value depends on our ability to develop, integrate, or
otherwise  interact  with  such  applications  within  the  bounds  of  our  legal  and  compliance  obligations.  The  legal  and  regulatory  landscape  for  such
products, including the law governing the rights and obligations between and among smart contract developers and users and the extent to which such
relationships  entail  regulated  activity  is  uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving.  Our  interaction  with  those  applications,  and  the  interaction  of  other  blockchain
users with any smart contracts or assets we may generate or control, could present legal, operational, reputational, and regulatory risks for our business.

We  may  be  further  subject  to  administrative  sanctions  for  technical  violations  or  customer  attrition  if  the  user  experience  suffers  as  a  result. As
another  example,  the  extension  of  anti-money  laundering  requirements  to  certain  crypto-related  activities  by  the  European  Union’s  Fifth  Money
Laundering  Directive  has  increased  the  regulatory  compliance  burden  for  our  business  in  Europe  and,  as  a  result  of  the  fragmented  approach  to  the
implementation  of  its  provisions,  resulted  in  distinct  and  divergent  national  licensing  and  registration  regimes  for  us  in  different  E.U.  member  states.
Additionally, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (“MiCA”) introduces a comprehensive authorization and compliance regime for crypto asset service
providers  and  a  disclosure  regime  for  the  issuers  of  certain  crypto  assets,  which  will  impact  our  operations  in  the  European  Union,  including  through
localization requirements, due to the obligations associated with our MiCA license (obtained in June 2025).

Because we have offered and will continue to offer a variety of innovative products and services to our customers, many of our offerings are subject
to  significant  regulatory  uncertainty  and  we  from  time  to  time  face  regulatory  inquiries  regarding  our  current  and  planned  products.  For  instance,  we
purchase USDC, a stablecoin redeemable on a one-to-one basis for U.S. dollars, from Circle and sell it to customers on our platform. The regulatory
treatment of fiat-backed stablecoins is highly uncertain and has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world. The
issuance,  purchase,  and  sale  of  such  stablecoins  may  implicate  a  variety  of  banking,  deposit,  money  transmission,  prepaid  access  and  stored  value,
anti-money  laundering,  commodities,  securities,  sanctions,  and  other  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United  States  and  in  other  jurisdictions.  There  are
substantial  uncertainties  as  to  how  these  requirements  would  apply  in  practice,  and  we  may  face  substantial  compliance  costs  to  operationalize  and
comply with these rules. Certain products and services offered by us that we believe are not subject to regulatory oversight, or are only subject to certain
regulatory  regimes,  such  as  the  Base  App  (formerly  Coinbase  Wallet),  a  standalone  mobile  application  that  allows  customers  to  manage  their  own
private keys and store their crypto assets directly on their mobile devices, may cause us to be deemed to be engaged in a form of regulated activity for
which licensure is required or cause us to become subject to new and additional forms of regulatory oversight. We also offer various staking, rewards,
and lending products, all of which are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, and could implicate a variety of laws and regulations worldwide. For
example, there is regulatory uncertainty regarding the status of our staking, lending, rewards, and other yield-generating activities under the U.S. federal
and state securities laws. While we have implemented policies and procedures, including geofencing for certain products and services, designed to help
monitor for and ensure compliance with existing and new laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we and our employees, contractors, and
agents  will  not  violate  or  otherwise  fail  to  comply  with  such  laws  and  regulations. To  the  extent  that  we  or  our  employees,  contractors,  or  agents  are
deemed or alleged to have violated or failed to comply with any laws or regulations, including related interpretations, orders, determinations, directives,
or guidance, we or they could be subject to a litany of civil, criminal, and administrative fines, penalties, orders and actions, including being required to
suspend or terminate the offering of certain products and services. Moreover, to the extent our customers nevertheless access our platform, products

56

Table of Contents

or services outside of jurisdictions where we have obtained required governmental licenses and authorization, we could similarly be subject to a variety
of civil, criminal, and administrative fines, penalties, orders and actions as a result of such activity.

Due  to  our  business  activities,  we  are  subject  to  ongoing  examinations,  oversight,  and  reviews  and  currently  are,  and  expect  in  the  future,  to  be
subject to investigations and inquiries, by U.S. federal and state regulators and foreign financial service regulators, many of which have broad discretion
to audit and examine our business. We are periodically subject to audits and examinations by these regulatory authorities. As a result of findings from
these audits and examinations, regulators have, are, and may in the future require us to take certain actions, including amending, updating, or revising
our compliance measures from time to time, limiting the kinds of customers that we provide services to, changing, terminating, or delaying our licenses
and the introduction of our existing or new product and services, and undertaking further external audit or being subject to further regulatory scrutiny,
including  investigations  and  inquiries.  We  have  received,  and  may  in  the  future  receive,  examination  reports  citing  violations  of  rules  and  regulations,
inadequacies  in  existing  compliance  programs,  and  requiring  us  to  enhance  certain  practices  with  respect  to  our  compliance  program,  including  due
diligence, monitoring, training, reporting, and recordkeeping. Implementing appropriate measures to properly remediate these examination findings may
require us to incur significant costs, and if we fail to properly remediate any of these examination findings, we could face civil litigation, significant fines,
damage awards, forced removal of certain employees including members of our executive team, barring of certain employees from participating in our
business in whole or in part, revocation of existing licenses, limitations on existing and new products and services, reputational harm, negative impact to
our existing relationships with regulators, exposure to criminal liability, or other regulatory consequences. Further, we believe increasingly strict legal and
regulatory  requirements  and  additional  regulatory  investigations  and  enforcement,  any  of  which  could  occur  or  intensify,  may  continue  to  result  in
changes to our business, as well as increased costs, and supervision and examination for ourselves, our agents, and service providers. Moreover, new
laws, regulations, or interpretations may result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions, including preventing or
delaying  us  from  offering  certain  products  or  services  offered  by  our  competitors  or  could  impact  how  we  offer  such  products  and  services. Adverse
changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our reputation and brand
and our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We operate in a highly competitive industry and we compete against unregulated or less regulated companies and companies with greater
financial and other resources, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to
compete effectively.

The  crypto  industry  is  highly  innovative,  rapidly  evolving,  and  characterized  by  healthy  competition,  experimentation,  changing  customer  needs,
frequent introductions of new products and services, and subject to uncertain and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. We expect competition
to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new products or enhance existing products. We face significant competition from a
variety of companies around the world, ranging from crypto-native companies, including decentralized exchanges, to large traditional financial services
incumbents and financial technology providers. Our main competition falls into the following categories:

•

•

traditional  financial  technology  and  brokerage  firms  that  have  entered  the  crypto  asset  market  in  recent  years  and  offer  overlapping  features
targeted at our customers;

companies focused on the crypto asset market, some of whom adhere to local regulations and directly compete with our platform, and others
who choose to operate outside of local rules and regulations or in jurisdictions with less stringent local rules and regulations and are potentially
able to more quickly adapt to trends, support a greater number of crypto assets, and develop new crypto-based products and services due to a
different standard of regulatory scrutiny;

•

crypto-focused companies and traditional financial incumbents that offer point or siloed solutions specifically targeted at institutional customers;

57

Table of Contents

•

•

decentralized and non-custodial platforms; and

stablecoins, other than USDC, and fiat currencies globally.

Historically, a major source of competition has been from companies, in particular those located outside the United States, who at times are and may
in the future be subject to significantly less stringent regulatory and compliance requirements in their local jurisdictions. Their business models rely on
being  unregulated  or  only  regulated  in  a  small  number  of  lower  compliance  jurisdictions,  whilst  also  offering  their  products  in  highly  regulated
jurisdictions, including the United States, without necessarily complying with the relevant regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions.

Given the uneven enforcement by United States and foreign regulators, many of these competitors have been able to operate from offshore while
offering large numbers of products and services to consumers, including in the United States, Europe, and other highly regulated jurisdictions, without
complying with the relevant licensing and other requirements in these jurisdictions, and historically without penalty. Due to our regulated status in several
jurisdictions  and  our  commitment  to  legal  and  regulatory  compliance,  we  have  not  been  able  to  offer  many  popular  products  and  services,  including
products and services that our unregulated or less regulated competitors are able to offer.

We  also  have  expended  significant  managerial,  operational,  and  compliance  costs  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  applicable  to  us  in  the
jurisdictions in which we operate, and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with these requirements, which these unregulated or less
regulated competitors have not had to incur.

Our competitors have made significant investments in research and development, and we expect these companies to continue to develop similar or
superior products and technologies that compete with our products. Further, more traditional financial and non-financial services businesses may choose
to offer crypto-based services in the future as the industry gains adoption and barriers to entry lower. As regulations and compliance requirements in the
United States become clearer, we may face increased competition from companies based in the United States. Our current and potential competitors
may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.

Our existing competitors have, and our potential competitors are expected to have, competitive advantages over us, such as:

•

•

•

the  ability  to  trade  crypto  assets  and  offer  products  and  services  that  we  do  not  support  or  offer  on  our  platform  (due  to  constraints  from
regulatory  authorities,  our  financial  institution  partners,  and  other  factors)  such  as  tokens  that  constitute  securities  or  derivative  instruments
under U.S. or foreign laws;

greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and larger market shares;

larger sales and marketing budgets and organizations;

• more established marketing, banking, and compliance relationships;

•

•

•

•

•

•

greater customer support resources;

greater resources to make acquisitions;

lower labor, compliance, risk mitigation, and research and development costs;

larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios;

greater number of applicable licenses or similar authorizations;

established core business models outside of the trading of crypto assets, allowing them to operate on lesser margins or at a loss;

58

Table of Contents

•

•

operations in certain jurisdictions with lower compliance costs and greater flexibility to explore new product offerings; and

substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.

If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors,

our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business, operating results, and financial
condition could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively.

We  compete  against  an  increasing  number  of  decentralized  and  noncustodial  platforms.  On  these  platforms,  users  can  interact  directly  with  a
market-making  smart  contract  or  onchain  trading  mechanism  to  earn  crypto  assets  or  to  exchange  one  type  of  crypto  asset  for  another  without  any
centralized  intermediary.  We  have  seen  increased  interest  in  certain  decentralized  platforms  with  transaction  volumes  rivaling  our  own  platform  on
multiple  occasions,  and  expect  interest  in  decentralized  and  noncustodial  platforms  to  grow  further  as  the  industry  develops.  If  the  demand  for
decentralized platforms grows and we are unable to compete with these decentralized and noncustodial platforms, including, for example, if we fail to
achieve sufficient decentralization and scaling of Base Chain (formerly Base) as an L2, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

As we continue to expand and localize our international activities, our obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of a
variety of jurisdictions will increase and we may be subject to inquiries, investigations, and enforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S.
regulators and governmental authorities, including those related to sanctions, export control, and anti-money laundering.

As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, policies,
and  legal  interpretations  of  both  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  and  those  into  which  we  offer  services  on  a  cross-border  basis.  For  instance,
financial  regulators  outside  the  United  States  have  increased  their  scrutiny  of  crypto  asset  exchanges  over  time,  such  as  by  requiring  crypto  asset
exchanges operating in their local jurisdictions to be regulated and licensed under local laws. Moreover, laws regulating financial services, the internet,
mobile  technologies,  crypto,  and  related  technologies  outside  of  the  United  States  are  highly  evolving,  extensive  and  often  impose  different,  more
specific,  or  even  conflicting  obligations  on  us,  as  well  as  broader  liability.  In  addition,  we  are  required  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  related  to
economic  sanctions  and  export  controls  enforced  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury’s  Office  of  Foreign Assets  Control  (“OFAC”)  and  the  U.S.
Department  of  Commerce’s  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security,  and  U.S.  anti-money  laundering  and  counter-terrorist  financing  laws  and  regulations,
enforced by FinCEN and certain state financial services regulators. U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations generally restrict dealings by
persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with certain jurisdictions that are the target of comprehensive embargoes, currently the Crimea Region, the Donetsk
People’s  Republic,  and  the  Luhansk  People’s  Republic  of  Ukraine,  Cuba,  Iran,  North  Korea,  and  Syria,  as  well  as  with  persons,  entities,  and
governments identified on certain prohibited party lists. Moreover, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the E.U., the United
Kingdom,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  imposed  wide-ranging  sanctions  on  Russia  and  Belarus  and  persons  and  entities  associated  with  Russia  and
Belarus. There can be no certainty regarding whether such governments or other governments will impose additional sanctions, or other economic or
military measures against Russia or Belarus. We have continued to engage in activity in Russia and Belarus and with customers associated with these
countries. At the same time, we have implemented additional processes and procedures to comply with these new sanctions. However, our activity in
Russia and Belarus and with these customers associated with these countries subjects us to further exposure to sanctions as they are released. We
have an OFAC compliance program in place that includes monitoring of IP addresses to identify prohibited jurisdictions

59

Table of Contents

and of blockchain addresses that have either been identified by OFAC as prohibited or that otherwise are believed by us to be associated with prohibited
persons  or  jurisdictions.  Nonetheless,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  our  compliance  program  will  prevent  transactions  with  particular  persons  or
addresses or prevent every potential violation of OFAC sanctions. From time to time, we have submitted voluntary disclosures to OFAC or responded to
administrative  subpoenas  from  OFAC.  Certain  of  these  voluntary  self-disclosures  are  currently  under  review  by  OFAC.  To  date,  none  of  those
proceedings has resulted in a monetary penalty or finding of violation. Any present or future government inquiries relating to sanctions could result in
negative consequences for us, including costs related to government investigations, financial penalties, and harm to our reputation. The impact on us
related to such matters could be substantial. Although we have implemented controls, and are working to implement additional controls and screening
tools  designed  to  prevent  sanctions  violations,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  we  will  not  inadvertently  provide  access  to  our  products  and  services  to
sanctioned parties or jurisdictions in the future.

Regulators  worldwide  frequently  study  each  other’s  approaches  to  the  regulation  of  the  cryptoeconomy.  Consequently,  developments  in  any
jurisdiction may influence other jurisdictions. New developments in one jurisdiction may be extended to additional services and other jurisdictions. As a
result, the risks created by any new law or regulation in one jurisdiction are magnified by the potential that they may be replicated, affecting our business
in another place or involving another service. Conversely, if regulations diverge worldwide, we may face difficulty adjusting our products, services, and
other aspects of our business with the same effect. These risks are heightened as we face increased competitive pressure from other similarly situated
businesses that engage in regulatory arbitrage to avoid the compliance costs associated with regulatory changes.

The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and
the  evolving  global  regulatory  environment,  could  result  in  a  single  event  prompting  a  large  number  of  overlapping  investigations  and  legal  and
regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our
reputation, damage our brand, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Due to the uncertain application of existing
laws and regulations, it may be that, despite our regulatory and legal analysis concluding that certain products and services are currently unregulated,
such products or services may indeed be subject to financial regulation, licensing, or authorization obligations that we have not obtained or with which
we  have  not  complied.  As  a  result,  we  are  at  a  heightened  risk  of  enforcement  action,  litigation,  regulatory,  and  legal  scrutiny  which  could  lead  to
sanctions, cease and desist orders, or other penalties and censures which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are, and may continue to be, subject to litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits, as well as investigations and enforcement
actions by regulators and governmental authorities. These matters are often expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We have been, currently are, and may from time to time become subject to claims, arbitrations, individual and class action lawsuits with respect to a
variety  of  matters,  including  employment,  consumer  protection,  intellectual  property,  privacy,  information  security,  data  protection,  advertising,  and
securities. In addition, we have been, currently are, and may from time to time become subject to, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries,
actions  or  requests,  other  proceedings  and  enforcement  actions  alleging  violations  of  laws,  rules,  and  regulations,  both  foreign  and  domestic.  For  a
description of our material litigation, regulatory investigations, and other proceedings, see Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The scope, determination, and impact of
claims, lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, disputes, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted
with certainty and may result in:

•

substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or penalties;

loss or non-renewal of existing licenses or authorizations, or prohibition from or delays in obtaining additional licenses or authorizations, required
for our business;

loss of productivity and high demands on employee time;

criminal sanctions or consent decrees;

termination of certain employees, including members of our executive team;

barring of certain employees from participating in our business in whole or in part;

orders that restrict our business or prevent us from offering certain products or services;

changes to our business model and practices;

delays to planned transactions, product launches or improvements; and

damage to our brand and reputation.

Because of our large customer base, actions against us may claim large monetary damages, even if the alleged per-customer harm is small or non-
existent.  From  time  to  time,  we  receive  letters  alleging  claims  on  behalf  of  our  users.  Due  to  our  large  customer  base,  the  ongoing  defense  and
resolution  or  settlement  of  these  alleged  claims  could  be  material  and  we  may  incur  significant  expenses  associated  with  arbitrating  or  litigating  the
claims. Moreover, to the extent that a deterioration of the crypto asset market occurs for a prolonged period, large platforms like us may become subject
to or the target of increased litigation and additional government and regulatory scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome, any such matters could adversely
affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of  management  resources,  reputational  damage,  and
other factors.

If we cannot keep pace with rapid industry changes to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and
services, and consequently our net revenue, could decline, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Our industry has been characterized by many rapid, significant, and disruptive products and services in recent years. These include decentralized
applications, DeFi, yield farming, non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), play-to-earn games, lending, staking and re-staking, token wrapping, governance tokens,
innovative programs to attract customers such as transaction fee mining programs, initiatives to attract traders such as trading competitions, airdrops
and  giveaways,  staking  reward  programs,  “layer  2”  blockchain  networks,  smart  contract  wallets,  and  novel  cryptocurrency  fundraising  and  distribution
schemes, such as “initial exchange offerings.” We expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, which may be superior to, or
render  obsolete,  the  products  and  services  that  we  currently  provide.  For  example,  decentralized  networks  and  other  disruptive  technologies  such  as
generative AI  may  fundamentally  alter  the  use  of  our  products  or  services  in  unpredictable  ways.  We  cannot  predict  the  effects  of  new  services  and
technologies on our business. However, our ability to grow our customer base and net revenue will depend heavily on our ability to innovate and create
successful new products and services, both independently and in conjunction with third-party developers. In particular, developing and incorporating new
products and services into our business may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. Any new
products or services could fail to attract customers, generate revenue, or perform or integrate well with third-party applications and platforms. In addition,
our  ability  to  adapt  and  compete  with  new  products  and  services  may  be  inhibited  by  regulatory  requirements  and  general  uncertainty  in  the  law,
constraints  by  our  financial  institution  partners  and  payment  processors,  third-party  intellectual  property  rights,  or  other  factors.  Moreover,  we  must
continue  to  enhance  our  technical  infrastructure  and  other  technology  offerings  to  remain  competitive  and  maintain  a  platform  that  has  the  required
functionality, performance,

61

Table of Contents

capacity,  security,  and  speed  to  attract  and  retain  customers,  including  large,  institutional,  high-frequency  and  high-volume  traders.  As  a  result,  we
expect  to  incur  significant  costs  and  expenses  to  develop  and  upgrade  our  technical  infrastructure  to  meet  the  evolving  needs  of  the  industry.  Our
success will depend on our ability to develop, scale, and incorporate new offerings and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry practices. If
we  are  unable  to  do  so  in  a  timely  or  cost-effective  manner,  our  ability  to  successfully  compete,  to  retain  existing  customers,  and  to  attract  new
customers may be impacted and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

A particular crypto asset, product or service’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and
if we are unable to properly characterize a crypto asset or product offering, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries, investigations,
fines, and other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

The  SEC  and  its  staff  have  taken  evolving  positions  as  to  whether  a  range  of  crypto  assets,  products  and  services  fall  within  the  definition  of  a
“security” under the U.S. federal securities laws. Despite the SEC being the principal federal securities law regulator in the United States, whether or not
an asset, product, or service is a security or constitutes a securities offering under federal securities laws is ultimately determined by a federal court. The
legal test for determining whether any given crypto asset, product, or service is an investment contract security was set forth in the 1946 Supreme Court
case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. and whether any given crypto asset, product, or service is a note in the 1990 Supreme Court case Reves v. Ernst & Young.
The  legal  tests  for  determining  whether  any  given  crypto  asset,  product,  or  service  is  a  security  requires  a  highly  complex,  fact-driven  analysis.
Accordingly, whether any given crypto asset, product or service would be ultimately deemed by a federal court to be a security is uncertain and difficult to
predict notwithstanding the conclusions of the SEC or any conclusions we may draw based on our risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a
particular  crypto  asset,  product  or  service  could  be  deemed  a  “security”  or  “securities  offering”  under  applicable  laws.  The  SEC  generally  does  not
provide advance guidance or confirmation on its assessment of the status of any particular crypto asset, product, or service as a security. Furthermore,
in our view, statements by the SEC and its staff have appeared contradictory at times. It is also possible that the change in the governing administration
and the appointment of new SEC commissioners will substantially impact the approach to enforcement by the SEC and its staff.

The SEC has also brought enforcement actions and entered into settlements with numerous cryptoeconomy participants alleging that certain digital
assets are securities. More recently, the SEC dismissed many of those enforcement actions. These statements, framework and enforcement actions are
not  rules  or  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  are  not  binding  on  the  SEC. As  noted  above,  whether  any  given  crypto  asset,  product  or  service  would  be
ultimately  deemed  by  a  federal  court  to  be  a  security  is  uncertain  and  difficult  to  predict.  Moreover,  the  SEC  and  the  Commodities  Futures  Trading
Commission  (the  “CFTC”)  and  their  senior  officials  have,  at  times,  taken  conflicting  positions  in  speeches  and  enforcement  actions  as  to  whether  a
particular crypto asset is a security or commodity. In January 2025, the SEC launched a crypto task force dedicated to developing a comprehensive and
clear regulatory framework for crypto assets. While newly formed, its goal is to clarify federal securities laws for crypto, recommend practical policies,
foster innovation, and protect investors.

Several  foreign  jurisdictions  have  taken  a  broad-based  approach  to  classifying  crypto  assets,  products  and  services  as  “securities,”  while  other
foreign jurisdictions have adopted a narrower approach. As a result, certain crypto assets, products or services may be deemed to be a “security” under
the laws of some jurisdictions but not others. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt additional laws, regulations, or directives that affect
the characterization of crypto assets, products or services as “securities.”

The classification of a crypto asset, product or service as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations
that flow from the offer, sale, trading, and clearing, as applicable, of such assets, products or services. For example, a crypto asset, product or service
that is a

62

Table of Contents

security in the United States may generally only be offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or in an
offering that qualifies for an exemption from registration. Persons that effect transactions in crypto assets, products or services that are securities in the
United States may be subject to registration with the SEC as a “broker” or “dealer.” Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade crypto
assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to registration as national securities exchanges, or must qualify for an exemption,
such  as  by  being  operated  by  a  registered  broker-dealer  as  an ATS  in  compliance  with  rules  for ATSs.  Persons  facilitating  clearing  and  settlement  of
securities  may  be  subject  to  registration  with  the  SEC  as  a  clearing  agency.  Foreign  jurisdictions  may  have  similar  licensing,  registration,  and
qualification requirements.

We have policies and procedures to analyze whether each crypto asset that we seek to facilitate trading on Coinbase Spot Market, as well as our
products and services, could be deemed to be a “security” under applicable laws. Our policies and procedures do not constitute a legal standard, but
rather represent our company-developed model, which we use to make a risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular crypto asset,
product or service could be deemed a “security” under applicable laws.

Because Coinbase Spot Market, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase app are not registered or licensed with the SEC or foreign authorities as a broker-
dealer, national securities exchange, or ATS (or foreign equivalents), we only permit trading of those crypto assets, and offer products and services, for
which we determine there are reasonably strong arguments to conclude that the crypto asset, product or service is not a security. We believe that our
process reflects a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis and is reasonably designed to facilitate consistent application of available legal guidance on
crypto  assets,  products  and  services  and  to  facilitate  informed  risk-based  business  judgment.  In  addition,  as  we  shared  in  our  petition  for  SEC
rulemaking, we remain open to registering or relying on an exemption to facilitate and offer the sale of securities involving crypto assets. We recognize
that the application of securities laws to the specific facts and circumstances of crypto assets, products and services may be complex and subject to
change, and that a listing determination does not guarantee any conclusion under the U.S. federal securities laws. Regardless of our conclusions, we
have been, and could in the future be, subject to legal or regulatory action in the event the SEC or a state or foreign regulatory authority were to assert,
or a court were to determine, that a supported crypto asset, product or service offered, sold, or traded on our platform or a product or service that we
offer is a “security” under applicable laws. There can be no assurance that we will properly characterize over time any given crypto asset, product or
service offering as a security or non-security, or that the SEC, foreign regulatory authority, or a court having final determinative authority on the topic, if
the question was presented to it, would agree with our assessment. We expect our risk assessment policies and procedures to continuously evolve to
take into account case law, legislative developments, facts, and developments in technology.

If an applicable regulatory authority or a court, in either case having final determinative authority on the topic, were to determine that a supported
crypto asset, product or service currently offered, sold, or traded on our platform is a security, we would not be able to offer such crypto asset for trading,
or  product  or  service  on  our  platform,  until  we  are  able  to  do  so  in  a  compliant  manner. A  determination  by  the  SEC,  a  state  or  foreign  regulatory
authority, or a court that an asset that we currently support for trading on our platform, or product or service that we offer on our platform, constitutes a
security may result in us removing that crypto asset from or ceasing to offer that product or service on our platform, and may also result in us determining
that it is advisable to remove assets from our platform, or to cease offering products and services on our platform, that have similar characteristics to the
asset, product or service that was alleged or determined to be a security. Alternatively, we may determine not to remove a particular crypto asset from
Coinbase  Spot  Market  or  to  continue  to  offer  a  product  or  service  on  our  platform  even  if  the  SEC  or  another  regulator  alleges  that  the  crypto  asset,
product or service is a security, pending a final judicial determination as to that crypto asset, product or service’s proper characterization, and the fact
that  we  waited  for  a  final  judicial  determination  would  generally  not  preclude  penalties  or  sanctions  against  us  for  our  having  previously  made  our
platform available for trading that crypto asset or offering that product or service on our platform without registering as a national securities

63

Table of Contents

exchange or ATS or registering tokens that we may issue, such as our cbETH and cbBTC tokens or our staking services, with the SEC. As such, we
could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions for failing to offer or sell the crypto asset, product or service in compliance with the registration
requirements, or for acting as a broker, dealer, or national securities exchange without appropriate registration. Such an action could result in injunctions,
cease  and  desist  orders,  as  well  as  civil  monetary  penalties,  fines,  and  disgorgement,  criminal  liability,  and  reputational  harm.  Customers  that  traded
such supported crypto asset on our platform and suffered trading losses could also seek to rescind a transaction that we facilitated on the basis that it
was conducted in violation of applicable law, which could subject us to significant liability. We may also be required to cease facilitating transactions in
the  supported  crypto  asset  other  than  via  our  licensed  subsidiaries,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition. Additionally, the SEC has brought and may in the future bring enforcement actions against other cryptoeconomy participants and their product
offerings and services that may cause us to modify or discontinue a product offering or service on our platform. If we were to modify or discontinue any
product offering or service or remove any assets from trading on our platform for any reason, our decision may be unpopular with users, may reduce our
ability to attract and retain customers (especially if similar products, services or such assets continue to be offered or traded on unregulated exchanges,
which includes many of our competitors), and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Further, if Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins or any other supported crypto asset is deemed to be a security under any U.S. federal, state, or foreign
jurisdiction,  or  in  a  proceeding  in  a  court  of  law  or  otherwise,  it  may  have  adverse  consequences  for  such  supported  crypto  asset.  For  instance,  all
transactions  in  such  supported  crypto  asset  would  have  to  be  registered  with  the  SEC  or  other  foreign  authority,  or  conducted  in  accordance  with  an
exemption from registration, which could severely limit its liquidity, usability and transactability. Moreover, the networks on which such supported crypto
assets  are  utilized  may  be  required  to  be  regulated  as  securities  intermediaries,  and  subject  to  applicable  rules,  which  could  effectively  render  the
network impracticable for its existing purposes. Further, it could draw negative publicity and a decline in the general acceptance of the crypto asset. Also,
it may make it difficult for such supported crypto asset to be traded, cleared, and custodied as compared to other crypto assets that are not considered to
be  securities.  Specifically,  even  if  transactions  in  such  supported  crypto  asset  were  registered  with  the  SEC  or  conducted  in  accordance  with  an
exemption  from  registration,  the  current  intermediary-based  framework  for  securities  trading,  clearance  and  settlement  is  not  consistent  with  the
operations  of  the  crypto  asset  market.  For  example,  the  SEC  has  not  permitted  public  permissionless  blockchain-based  clearance  and  settlement
systems for securities.

We currently rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our operations, and any interruptions in services provided by these
third parties may impair our ability to support our customers.

We  rely  on  third  parties  in  connection  with  many  aspects  of  our  business,  including  payment  processors,  financial  institutions,  and  payment
gateways to process transactions; cloud computing services and data centers that provide facilities, infrastructure, smart contract development, website
functionality  and  access,  components,  and  services,  including  databases  and  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing;  as  well  as  third  parties  that
provide outsourced customer service, compliance support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations. Because we rely on
third parties to provide these services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risks. We do not directly manage
the  operation  of  any  of  these  third  parties,  including  their  data  center  facilities  that  we  use.  These  third  parties  may  be  subject  to  financial,  legal,
regulatory,  and  labor  issues,  cybersecurity  incidents,  data  theft  or  loss,  break-ins,  computer  viruses  or  vulnerabilities  in  their  code,  denial-of-service
attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, loss, disruption, or instability of third-party financial institution relationships, privacy breaches, service terminations,
disruptions, interruptions, and other misconduct. They are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, power loss, telecommunications
failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, pandemics and similar events. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements
with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these

64

Table of Contents

agreements  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all,  fail  or  refuse  to  process  transactions  or  provide  other  services  adequately,  take  actions  that
degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to competitors.
There can be no assurance that third parties that provide services to us or to our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or
at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf,
such  as  if  third-party  service  providers  to  close  their  data  center  facilities  without  adequate  notice,  are  unable  to  restore  operations  and  data,  fail  to
perform  as  expected,  or  experience  other  unanticipated  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  procure  alternatives  in  a  timely  and  efficient  manner  and  on
acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction,
reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

Loss of a critical financial institution or insurance relationship could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We rely on financial institution relationships to provide our platform and custodial services. In particular, customer cash holdings on our platform are
held with one or more financial institutions. As a registered money services business with FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations enforced by FinCEN, or collectively, the BSA, a licensed money transmitter in a number of U.S.
states and territories, a licensee under NYDFS’s Virtual Currency Business Activity regime, commonly referred to as a BitLicense, a licensed electronic
money institution under both the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Central Bank of Ireland, and a limited purpose trust company chartered by the
NYDFS, our financial institution partners view us as a higher risk customer for purposes of their anti-money laundering programs. We may face difficulty
establishing  or  maintaining  such  relationships  due  to  instability  in  the  global  banking  system,  increasing  regulatory  uncertainty  and  scrutiny,  or  our
partners’ policies and some prior partners have terminated their relationship with us or have limited access to services. The loss of these partners or the
imposition of operational restrictions by these partners and the inability for us to utilize other redundant financial institutions may result in a disruption of
business  activity  as  well  as  regulatory  risks.  In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  myriad  of  regulations  or  the  risks  of  crypto  assets  generally,  financial
institutions in the United States and globally may decide to not provide, or be prohibited from providing, account, custody, or other financial services to us
or  the  cryptoeconomy  generally.  Further,  we  have  existing  redundancies  in  U.S.  and  global  financial  institutions  that  work  with  crypto  companies  with
which we engage.

However,  if  these  financial  institutions  are  subject  to  bank  resolution  or  failure,  or  limit  or  end  their  crypto  market  activity,  or  if  such  relationships
become severely limited or unavailable to crypto market participants in a certain country, there could be temporary delays in or unavailability of services
in  such  country  that  are  critical  to  our  or  our  partners’  operations,  developers  or  customers,  a  further  limit  on  available  vendors,  reduced  quality  in
services  we,  our  partners,  our  developers  or  our  customers  are  able  to  obtain,  and  a  general  disruption  to  the  cryptoeconomy,  potentially  leading  to
reduced activity on our platform which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, while our business
and operations have not been materially affected by the closures of Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank and the cessation of their real-time fiat
currency  payment  networks  in  March  2023,  large  cryptoeconomy  participants,  including  us  and  our  institutional  customers,  experienced  a  temporary
inability to transfer fiat currencies outside of standard business hours.

We also rely on insurance carriers to insure customer losses resulting from a breach of our physical security, cybersecurity, or by employee or third
party  theft  and  hold  surety  bonds  as  required  for  compliance  with  certain  of  our  licenses  under  applicable  state  laws.  Our  ability  to  maintain  crime,
specie, and cyber insurance, as well as surety bonds, is subject to the insurance carriers’ ongoing underwriting criteria and our inability to obtain and
maintain  appropriate  insurance  coverage  could  cause  a  substantial  business  disruption,  adverse  reputational  impact,  inability  to  compete  with  our
competitors, and regulatory scrutiny, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Any significant disruption in our products and services, in our information technology systems, or in any of the blockchain networks we
support, could result in a loss of customers or funds and adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Our  reputation  and  ability  to  attract  and  retain  customers  and  grow  our  business  depends  on  our  ability  to  operate  our  service  at  high  levels  of
reliability, scalability, and performance, including the ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions that occur at high
volume  and  frequencies  across  multiple  systems.  For  example,  in  March  2023,  there  was  a  temporary  disruption  to  USDC  services  for  several  days
following  the  news  of  Silicon  Valley  Bank’s  closure.  Our  platform,  the  ability  of  our  customers  to  trade,  and  our  ability  to  operate  at  a  high  level,  are
dependent  on  our  ability  to  access  the  blockchain  networks  underlying  the  supported  crypto  assets,  for  which  access  is  dependent  on  our  systems’
ability  to  access  the  internet.  Further,  the  successful  and  continued  operations  of  such  blockchain  networks  will  depend  on  a  network  of  computers,
miners, or validators, and their continued operations, all of which may be impacted by service interruptions.

Our systems, the systems of our third-party service providers and partners, and certain crypto asset and blockchain networks have experienced from
time to time, and may experience in the future service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed
denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, break-ins, sabotage, human error, vandalism, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other
natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  in  telecommunications  services,  fraud,  military  or  political  conflicts,  terrorist  attacks,  computer  viruses  or
other  malware,  or  other  events.  In  addition,  extraordinary  Trading  Volumes  or  site  usage  could  cause  our  computer  systems  to  operate  at  an
unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Some of our systems, including systems of companies we have acquired, or the systems of our third-party service
providers and partners are not fully redundant, and our or their disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events.

If  any  of  our  systems,  or  those  of  our  third-party  service  providers,  are  disrupted  for  any  reason,  our  products  and  services  may  fail,  resulting  in
unanticipated disruptions, slower response times and delays in our customers’ trade execution and processing, failed settlement of trades, incomplete or
inaccurate  accounting,  recording  or  processing  of  trades,  unauthorized  trades,  loss  of  customer  information,  increased  demand  on  limited  customer
support resources, customer claims, complaints with regulatory organizations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions. Further, when these disruptions occur,
we have in the past, and may in the future, fulfill customer transactions using inventory to prevent adverse user impact and limit detrimental impact to our
operating results. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could harm
our business. Significant or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers or partners to believe that our systems are
unreliable,  leading  them  to  switch  to  our  competitors  or  to  avoid  or  reduce  the  use  of  our  products  and  services,  and  could  permanently  harm  our
reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners,
these  customers  or  partners  could  seek  significant  compensation  or  contractual  penalties  from  us  for  their  losses,  and  those  claims,  even  if
unsuccessful,  would  likely  be  time-consuming  and  costly  for  us  to  address.  Problems  with  the  reliability  or  security  of  our  systems  would  harm  our
reputation and the cost of remedying these problems could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, interruptions have resulted and in the future may result in regulatory scrutiny,
and significant or persistent interruptions could lead to significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and
ultimately  could  cause  us  to  lose  existing  licenses  or  financial  institution  relationships  that  we  need  to  operate  or  prevent  or  delay  us  from  obtaining
additional licenses that may be required for our business.

In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies
is  complex,  expensive,  time-consuming,  and  may  not  be  successful.  If  we  fail  to  timely  and  successfully  implement  new  information  systems  and
technologies,

66

Table of Contents

or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, it could
adversely affect our internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), and our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our failure to securely store and manage our and our customers’ fiat currencies and crypto assets could adversely affect our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

We  hold  cash  and  store  crypto  assets  on  behalf  of  our  customers  and  hold  fiat  and  crypto  for  corporate  investment  and  operating  purposes.  In
addition,  following  the  acquisition  of  Coinbase Asset  Management,  formerly  One  River  Digital Asset  Management  (“CBAM”),  we  additionally  store  an
immaterial amount of cryptocurrencies at third-party custodians for asset management products.

Securely  storing  customers’  cash  and  crypto  assets  is  integral  to  the  trust  we  build  with  our  customers.  We  believe  our  policies,  procedures,
operational controls and controls over financial reporting, protect us from material risks surrounding the storing of these assets and conflicts of interest.
Our controls over financial reporting include among others, controls over the segregation of corporate crypto asset balances from customer crypto asset
balances,  controls  over  the  processes  of  customer  crypto  asset  deposits  and  customer  crypto  asset  withdrawals  and  corporate  and  customer  fiat
balances. Our financial statements and disclosures, as a whole, are available through periodic filings on a quarterly basis, and compliant with annual
audit requirements of Article 3 of Regulation S-X.

We  hold  cash  at  financial  institutions  in  accounts  designated  as  for  the  benefit  of  our  customers.  We  have  also  entered  into  partnerships  or  joint
ventures with third parties, such as with Circle, where we or our partners receive and hold customer funds. Our and our financial partners’ abilities to
manage and accurately hold customer cash and cash we hold for our own investment and operating purposes requires a high level of internal controls.
We are limited in our ability to influence or manage the controls and processes of third-party partners or vendors and may be dependent on our partners’
and vendors’ operations, liquidity and financial condition to manage these risks. As we maintain, grow and expand our product and services offerings we
also  must  scale  and  strengthen  our  internal  controls  and  processes,  and  monitor  our  third-party  partners’  and  vendors’  ability  to  similarly  scale  and
strengthen. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. This is important both to the actual controls
and processes and the public perception of the same.

Any  inability  by  us  to  maintain  our  procedures,  perceived  or  otherwise,  could  harm  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.
Accordingly, we take steps to ensure customer cash is always secure. Customer cash and crypto asset balances are maintained through our internal
ledgering  processes.  Customer  cash  is  maintained  in  segregated  Company  financial  institution  accounts  that  are  held  for  the  exclusive  benefit  of
customers with our financial institution partners or in government money market funds or other permissible investments. We store crypto assets using
proprietary technology and operational processes. Crypto assets are not insured or guaranteed by any government or government agency, however we
have  worked  hard  to  securely  store  our  customers’  crypto  assets  and  our  own  crypto  assets  for  investment  and  operational  purposes  with  legal  and
operational protections.

Any material failure by us or our partners to maintain the necessary controls, policies, procedures or to manage the crypto assets we hold for our
own investment and operating purposes could also adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, any material failure
by us or our partners to maintain the necessary controls or to manage customer crypto assets and funds appropriately and in compliance with applicable
regulatory  requirements  could  result  in  reputational  harm,  litigation,  regulatory  enforcement  actions,  significant  financial  losses,  lead  customers  to
discontinue  or  reduce  their  use  of  our  and  our  partners’  products,  and  result  in  significant  penalties  and  fines  and  additional  restrictions,  which  could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the
property  of  a  bankruptcy  estate,  in  the  event  of  a  bankruptcy,  the  crypto  assets  we  hold  in  custody  on  behalf  of  our  customers  could  be  subject  to
bankruptcy  proceedings  and  such  customers  could  be  treated  as  our  general  unsecured  creditors. This  may  result  in  customers  finding  our  custodial
services more risky and less

67

Table of Contents

attractive  and  any  failure  to  increase  our  customer  base,  discontinuation  or  reduction  in  use  of  our  platform  and  products  by  existing  customers  as  a
result could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, following the acquisition of CBAM, some of our asset
management products hold customer assets at third-party custodians with their own bankruptcy protection procedures.

We place great importance on securely storing crypto assets we custody and keeping them bankruptcy remote from our general creditors, and in
June 2022 we updated our Retail User Agreement to clarify the applicability of UCC Article 8 to custodied crypto assets – the same legal protection that
our  institutional  custody  and  prime  broker  clients  also  rely  upon.  UCC Article  8  provides  that  financial  assets  held  by  Coinbase  are  not  property  of
Coinbase and not subject to the claims of its general creditors. In light of UCC Article 8, we believe that a court would not treat custodied crypto assets
as part of our general estate; however, due to the novelty of crypto assets, courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied crypto
assets.

We  deposit,  transfer,  and  custody  customer  cash  and  crypto  assets  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  In  each  instance,  we  require  bank-level  security
encryption  to  store  customers’  assets  for  our  wallet  and  storage  systems,  as  well  as  our  financial  management  systems  related  to  such  custodial
functions. Our security technology is designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate inappropriate access to our systems, by internal or external threats. We
believe we have developed and maintained administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to comply with applicable legal requirements and
industry  standards.  However,  it  is  nevertheless  possible  that  hackers,  employees  or  service  providers  acting  contrary  to  our  policies,  or  others  could
circumvent these measures to improperly access our systems or documents, or the systems or documents of our business partners, agents, or service
providers, and improperly access, obtain, or misuse customer crypto assets and funds. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or
degrade  service  or  sabotage  systems  are  also  constantly  changing  and  evolving  and  may  be  difficult  to  anticipate  or  detect  for  long  periods  of  time.
Certain  of  our  customer  contracts  do  not  limit  our  liability  with  respect  to  security  breaches  and  other  security-related  matters  and  our  insurance
coverage for such impropriety is limited and may not cover the extent of loss nor the nature of such loss, in which case we may be liable for the full
amount  of  losses  suffered,  which  could  be  greater  than  all  of  our  assets.  Our  ability  to  maintain  insurance  is  also  subject  to  the  insurance  carriers’
ongoing underwriting criteria. Any loss of customer cash or crypto assets could result in a subsequent lapse in insurance coverage, which could cause a
substantial business disruption, adverse reputational impact, inability to compete with our competitors, and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or actions.
Additionally,  transactions  undertaken  through  our  websites  or  other  electronic  channels  may  create  risks  of  fraud,  hacking,  unauthorized  access  or
acquisition, and other deceptive practices. Any security incident resulting in a compromise of customer assets could result in substantial costs to us and
require us to notify impacted individuals, and in some cases regulators, of a possible or actual incident, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions,
including substantial fines, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation, significant financial losses, damage our reputation, and adversely
affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

The theft, loss, or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account or for our customers
may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or other data loss relating to our ability to access
any crypto assets, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses.

Crypto assets are generally controllable only by the possessor of the unique private key relating to the digital wallet in which the crypto assets are
held. While blockchain protocols typically require public addresses to be published when used in a transaction, private keys must be secured and kept
private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the crypto assets held in such a wallet. To the extent that any of the private keys relating to our
wallets  containing  crypto  assets  held  for  our  own  account  or  for  our  customers  is  lost,  destroyed,  or  otherwise  compromised  or  unavailable,  and  no
backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the crypto assets held in the related wallet. Further, we cannot provide assurance
that our wallets will not be hacked or compromised. Crypto assets and blockchain

68

Table of Contents

technologies have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking, or other malicious activities. Any loss of private keys relating to,
or hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our customers’ crypto assets could adversely affect our customers’ ability to access or sell
their crypto assets, require us to reimburse our customers for their losses, and subject us to significant financial losses in addition to losing customer
trust in us and our products. As such, any loss of private keys due to a hack, employee or service provider misconduct or error, or other compromise by
third parties could hurt our brand and reputation, result in significant losses, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

To  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  the  loss  or  theft  of  keys,  we  utilize  both  hot  wallets  and  cold  wallets  in  our  custodial  solutions.  We  actively
manage  wallet  balances  and  generally  seek  to  hold  no  more  than  2%  of  custodied  assets  in  hot  wallets  at  any  given  time.  Cold  wallet  private  key
materials  are  stored  and  secured  at  facilities  within  the  United  States  and  internationally.  We  store  the  substantial  majority  of  our  own  crypto  asset
holdings utilizing the same storage solutions that we provide to our customers. In limited cases, we use storage solutions not offered to our customers to
store immaterial amounts of crypto held for corporate purposes outside of our core custodial product offerings. Additionally, our CBAM offering utilizes
both Coinbase and third parties as custodians.

At all times, we hold corporate assets in excess of the total amount of assets held in our hot wallets. Similar to most financial institutions, the total
customer assets on our platform, such as those assets held in cold storage, are substantially more than our corporate assets and available insurance.
While  we  have  for  years  maintained,  and  continue  to  maintain,  a  commercial  crime  insurance  policy,  which  has  a  one-year  term  without  automatic
renewals, in the event of a loss from our cold wallets, our assets may be insufficient to cover amounts that exceed our insurance coverage. We may be
liable for such uninsured losses where we are required to reimburse customers, and such liability could adversely affect our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

Other Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position

If we fail to retain existing customers or add new customers, or if our customers decrease their level of engagement with our products,
services and platform, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be significantly harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, including developers, to increase engagement with our
products,  services,  and  platform.  To  do  so,  we  must  continue  to  offer  leading  technologies  and  ensure  that  our  products  and  services  are  secure,
reliable,  and  engaging.  We  must  also  expand  our  products  and  services,  and  offer  competitive  prices  in  an  increasingly  crowded  and  price-sensitive
market. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so, that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers, or
keep our customers engaged. Any number of factors can negatively affect customer retention, growth, and engagement, including if:

•

•

•

•

•

•

customers  increasingly  engage  with  competing  products  and  services,  including  products  and  services  that  we  are  unable  to  offer  due  to
regulatory reasons;

we fail to introduce new and improved products and services, or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received;

we fail to support new and in-demand crypto assets or if we elect to support crypto assets with negative reputations;

there are changes in sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products and services or concerns related to privacy, security, fiat pegging
or other factors;

there are adverse changes in our products and services that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation;

customers  perceive  the  crypto  assets  on  our  platform  to  be  bad  investments,  or  experience  significant  losses  in  investments  made  on  our
platform;

69

Table of Contents

•

•

technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products and services with the speed, functionality, security, and reliability that our
customers expect;

cybersecurity incidents, employee or service provider misconduct, or other unforeseen activities cause losses to us or our customers, including
losses to assets held by us on behalf of our customers;

• modifications to our pricing model or modifications by competitors to their pricing models;

•

•

•

we fail to provide adequate customer service;

regulatory and governmental bodies in countries that we target for expansion express negative views towards crypto asset trading platforms and,
more broadly, the cryptoeconomy; or

we or other companies or high-profile figures in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity.

From  time  to  time,  certain  of  these  factors  have  negatively  affected  customer  retention,  growth,  and  engagement  to  varying  degrees.  If  we  are
unable  to  maintain  or  increase  our  customer  base  and  customer  engagement,  our  revenue  and  financial  results  may  be  adversely  affected.  Any
decrease  in  user  retention,  growth,  or  engagement  could  render  our  products  and  services  less  attractive  to  customers  and  lead  to  a  decrease  in
revenue, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. If our customer growth rate slows or declines, we will
become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive growth of revenue.

Our operating expenses may increase in the future and we may not be successful in increasing our revenue to sufficiently offset these higher
expenses, which could impact our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow from operations on a consistent basis and cause our
business, operating results, and financial condition to be adversely affected.

Our  operating  expenses  may  increase  in  the  future  as  we  continue  to  grow  our  business.  While  we  consistently  evaluate  opportunities  to  drive
efficiency,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  these  efforts  will  be  successful  or  that  we  will  not  need  to  accelerate  operating  expenditures  in  the  future.  Our
operations may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our net revenue sufficiently to offset these
higher  expenses. Additionally,  our  revenue  growth  may  be  negatively  impacted  by,  among  other  things,  reduced  demand  for  our  offerings,  increased
competition, adverse macroeconomic conditions, any decrease in the growth or size of the cryptoeconomy, regulatory uncertainty or scrutiny, changes
that impact our ability to offer certain products or services, or failure of new products and services to gain market adoption. As a result, we cannot be
certain that we will be able to achieve profitability or achieve positive operating cash flow on any quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to effectively
manage these risks and difficulties as we encounter them, our business, operating results, and financial condition may suffer.

If we do not effectively manage our growth, including by maintaining and improving our systems and processes, our business, operating
results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We have experienced, and may experience in the future, periods of significant growth. To effectively manage and capitalize on our growth periods,
we  will  need  to  manage  headcount,  capital,  and  processes  efficiently  while  making  investments  such  as  expanding  our  information  technology  and
financial, operating, and administrative systems and controls, and such initiatives could strain our resources. We could experience operating difficulties in
managing  our  business  as  it  expands  across  numerous  jurisdictions,  including  difficulties  in  hiring,  training,  managing  and  retaining  a  remote  and
evolving  employee  base.  If  we  do  not  adapt  or  scale  to  meet  these  evolving  challenges,  we  may  experience  erosion  to  our  brand,  the  quality  of  our
products and services may suffer, and our company culture may be harmed. Moreover, the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our
ability to provide

70

Table of Contents

accurate,  timely,  and  reliable  reports  on  our  financial  and  operating  results,  including  the  financial  statements  provided  herein,  and  could  impact  the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or
fraud. Any of the foregoing operational failures could lead to noncompliance with laws and regulations, loss of operating licenses or other authorizations,
or loss of financial institution relationships that could substantially impair or even suspend company operations.

Successful implementation of our growth strategy will also require significant expenditures before any substantial associated revenue is generated
and we cannot guarantee that these increased investments will result in corresponding and offsetting revenue growth. Because we have a limited history
operating our business at its current scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model
future growth. Our limited operating experience at this scale, combined with the rapidly evolving and volatile nature of the crypto asset market in which
we operate, and other economic factors beyond our control, reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue.

Additionally, from time to time, we have realigned our resources and talent to implement stage-appropriate business strategies, including layoffs and
reductions in force. For example, in June 2022 and in January 2023, in response to rapidly changing economic conditions and in an effort to reduce our
operational  costs  and  improve  our  organizational  efficiency,  we  reduced  our  workforce.  If  there  are  unforeseen  expenses  associated  with  such
realignments in our business strategies, and we incur unanticipated charges or liabilities, then we may not be able to effectively realize the expected cost
savings  or  other  benefits  of  such  actions.  Failure  to  manage  any  growth  or  any  scaling  back  of  our  operations  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our strategy and focus on delivering high-quality, compliant, easy-to-use, and secure crypto-related financial services may not maximize
short-term or medium-term financial results.

We have taken, and expect to continue to take, actions that we believe are in the best interests of our customers and the long-term interests of our
business,  even  if  those  actions  do  not  necessarily  maximize  short-term  or  medium-term  results.  These  include  expending  significant  managerial,
technical, and legal efforts on complying with laws and regulations that are applicable to our products and services and ensuring that our products are
secure.  We  also  focus  on  driving  long-term  engagement  with  our  customers  through  innovation  and  developing  new  industry-leading  products  and
technologies. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term and medium-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the
long-term benefits that we expect, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Laws and regulations regarding conflicts of interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics, digital engagement practices, and
similar technologies, if adopted and found to be applicable to our business, may require us to modify, limit, or discontinue our use of certain
technologies and features contained within our products and services and may impact the way that we interact with existing and prospective
customers, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our products, services and educational offerings incorporate a holistic, customer-centric set of digital engagement practices, including educational
content  and  notifications,  which  are  designed,  in  part,  to  promote  financial  literacy  and  awareness  and  to  provide  customers  with  guidance  and
information  to  help  them  make  better  informed  decisions  about  their  crypto  activity.  Certain  jurisdictions  have  proposed  or  are  considering  laws  and
regulations regarding conflicts of interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics, digital engagement practices, and similar technologies by
broker-dealers, investment advisers and/or other securities market participants. If adopted and found to apply to our business, such laws or regulations
may impose obligations on us that may require us to modify, limit, or discontinue our use of certain technologies and features used in connection with our
products and services and/or to change the

71

Table of Contents

way that we interact with existing and prospective customers, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

A significant amount of the Trading Volume on our platform is derived from a relatively small number of users, and the loss of these users, or
a reduction in their Trading Volume, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

A relatively small number of institutional market makers and high-transaction volume consumer customers account for a significant amount of the
Trading  Volume  on  our  platform  and  our  net  revenue.  We  expect  significant  Trading  Volume  and  net  revenue  attributable  to  these  users  for  the
foreseeable future. As a result, a loss of these users, or a reduction in their Trading Volume, and our inability to replace these users with other users,
could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Due to our limited operating history, it may be difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects, and we may not be able to achieve or
maintain profitability in any given period.

We began our operations in 2012 and since then our business model has continued to evolve. Our net revenue has significantly grown since our
formation,  but  there  is  no  assurance  that  growth  will  continue  in  future  periods  and  you  should  not  rely  on  growth  of  our  revenue  in  any  given  prior
quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. For example, while we generated $7.4 billion in net revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2021, our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 declined to $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, primarily
due to declining crypto prices, lower crypto asset volatility, and uncertainty in the cryptoeconomy following the 2022 Events, before increasing to $6.3
billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. If our net revenue were to decline significantly for any extended period of time, our business, operating
results,  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected.  Our  limited  operating  history  and  the  volatile  nature  of  our  business  make  it  difficult  to
evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties as described in this
section. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Because our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our sales to customers outside the United States, our business is
susceptible to risks associated with international operations.

We currently have subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. We plan to enter into or increase our presence in additional markets around the
world. We have a limited operating history outside the United States, and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally
requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to particular challenges of supporting a growing business in an environment
of  diverse  cultures,  languages,  customs,  tax  laws,  legal  systems,  alternate  dispute  systems,  and  regulatory  systems. As  we  continue  to  expand  our
business and customer base outside the United States, we will be increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations. These risks
and challenges include:

•

•

•

•

difficulty establishing and managing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure, including establishment of local
customer  service  operations,  local  infrastructure  to  manage  supported  cryptocurrency  or  other  financial  instruments  and  corresponding  books
and records, and legal and regulatory compliance costs associated with different jurisdictions;

the need to vary pricing and margins to effectively compete in international markets;

the need to adapt and localize our products and services for specific countries, including offering services and support in local languages;

compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations across different jurisdictions;

72

Table of Contents

compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, as well as economic and
trade sanctions;

the need to comply with a greater set of law enforcement inquiries including those subject to mutual legal assistance treaties;

compliance with the extraterritorial reach of any U.S. regulatory rules, including those imposed by the CFTC, SEC, FinCEN or other U.S. based
regulators;

difficulties obtaining and maintaining required licensing from regulators in foreign jurisdictions;

competition with companies that have greater experience in the local markets, pre-existing relationships with customers in these markets or are
subject to less regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;

varying levels of payments and blockchain technology adoption and infrastructure, and increased network, payment processing, banking, and
other costs;

compliance  with  anti-bribery  laws,  including  compliance  with  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act,  the  U.K.  Bribery  Act  2010,  and  other  local
anticorruption laws;

difficulties collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;

difficulties holding, repatriating, and transferring funds held in offshore bank accounts;

difficulties adapting to foreign customary commercial practices, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, longer payment cycles
and other collection difficulties;

restrictions on crypto asset trading;

stringent local labor laws and regulations;

potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;

antitrust and competition regulations; and

regional economic and political conditions.

We  have  limited  experience  with  international  regulatory  environments  and  market  practices  and  may  not  be  able  to  penetrate  or  successfully
operate in the markets we choose to enter. In addition, we may incur significant expenses as a result of our international expansion, and we may not be
successful. We may face limited brand recognition in certain parts of the world that could lead to non-acceptance or delayed acceptance of our products
and services by customers in new markets. We may also face challenges in complying with local laws and regulations. For example, we may be subject
to regulatory frameworks that are evolving, have not undergone extensive rulemaking, and could result in uncertain outcomes for our customers and/or
our  ability  to  offer  competitive  products  in  the  broader  cryptoeconomy.  Our  failure  to  successfully  manage  these  risks  could  harm  our  international
operations and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Disputes with our customers could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.

From  time  to  time  we  have  been,  and  may  in  the  future  be,  subject  to  claims  and  disputes  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  our  products  and
services, such as regarding the execution and settlement of crypto asset trades, fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, account takeovers, deposits
and withdrawals of crypto assets, failures or malfunctions of our systems and services, or other issues relating to our products services. For example,
during periods of heavy Trading Volumes, we have received increased customer complaints. Additionally, the ingenuity of criminal fraudsters, combined
with many consumer users’ susceptibility to fraud, may cause our customers to be subject to ongoing account takeovers and identity fraud issues. While
we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, there is no guarantee that they will be successful and, in any case, require continuous
improvement and optimization

73

Table of Contents

for continually evolving forms of fraud to be effective. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in detecting and resolving these disputes or
defending  ourselves  in  any  of  these  matters,  and  any  failure  may  result  in  impaired  relationships  with  our  customers,  damage  to  our  brand  and
reputation, and substantial fines and damages. In some cases, the measures we have implemented to detect and deter fraud have led to poor customer
experiences,  including  indefinite  account  inaccessibility  for  some  of  our  customers,  which  increases  our  customer  support  costs  and  can  compound
damages.  We  could  incur  significant  costs  in  compensating  our  customers,  such  as  if  a  transaction  was  unauthorized,  erroneous,  or  fraudulent.  We
could also incur significant legal expenses resolving and defending claims, even those without merit. To the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill
our  regulatory  obligations,  we  could  also  lose  our  authorizations  or  licenses  or  become  subject  to  conditions  that  could  make  future  operations  more
costly,  impair  our  ability  to  grow,  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  We  currently  are,  or  may  in  the  future
become,  subject  to  investigation  and  enforcement  action  by  state,  federal,  and  international  consumer  protection  agencies,  including  the  Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), state agencies and attorneys general in the United States, the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority, the U.K. Financial Ombudsman Service, and the U.K. Office of Fair Trading, each of which monitors customer complaints against us
and, from time to time, escalates matters for investigation and potential enforcement against us.

While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer
class action litigation, some federal, state, and foreign courts have refused or may refuse to enforce one or more of these provisions, and there can be
no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given
case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class
action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could
subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer
class action litigation.

We may suffer losses due to staking, delegating, and other related services we provide to our customers.

Certain  supported  crypto  assets  enable  holders  to  earn  rewards  by  participating  in  decentralized  governance,  bookkeeping  and  transaction
confirmation activities on their underlying blockchain networks, such as through staking activities, including staking through validation, delegating, and
baking. We currently provide and expect to continue to provide such services for certain supported crypto assets to our customers in order to enable
them to earn rewards based on crypto assets that we hold on their behalf. For instance, as a service to customers and at their instruction, we operate
staking  nodes  on  certain  blockchain  networks  utilizing  customers’  crypto  assets  and  pass  through  the  rewards  received  to  those  customers,  less  a
service fee. In other cases, upon customers’ instructions, we may delegate our customers’ assets to third-party service providers that are unaffiliated with
us. Some networks may further require customer assets to be transferred into smart contracts on the underlying blockchain networks not under our or
anyone’s control. If our validator, any third-party service providers, or smart contracts fail to behave as expected, suffer cybersecurity attacks, experience
security  issues,  or  encounter  other  problems,  our  customers’  assets  may  be  irretrievably  lost.  In  addition,  certain  blockchain  networks  dictate
requirements for participation in the relevant decentralized governance activity, and may impose penalties, or “slashing,” if the relevant activities are not
performed correctly, such as if the staker, delegator, or baker acts maliciously on the network, “double signs” any transactions, or experience extended
downtimes.  If  we  or  any  of  our  service  providers  are  slashed  by  the  underlying  blockchain  network,  our  customers’  assets  may  be  confiscated,
withdrawn, or burnt by the network, resulting in losses for which we may be responsible. Furthermore, certain types of staking require the payment of
transaction  fees  on  the  underlying  blockchain  network  and  such  fees  can  become  significant  as  the  amount  and  complexity  of  the  transaction  grows,
depending on the degree of network congestion and the price of the network token. If we experience a high volume of such staking requests from our
customers

74

Table of Contents

on  an  ongoing  basis,  we  could  incur  significant  costs. Any  penalties  or  slashing  events  could  damage  our  brand  and  reputation,  cause  us  to  suffer
financial losses, discourage existing and future customers from utilizing our products and services, and adversely affect our business, operating results,
and financial condition.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations, including our obligations under the 2026 Convertible
Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes.

Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes, and our other
obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us
to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including each series of the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and
Senior Notes, and other obligations.

If  we  are  unable  to  service  our  debt  and  other  obligations  from  cash  flows,  we  may  need  to  refinance  or  restructure  all  or  a  portion  of  our  debt
obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets
and  our  financial  condition  at  such  time. Any  refinancing  or  restructuring  could  be  at  higher  interest  rates  and  may  require  us  to  comply  with  more
onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also limit our subsidiaries’ ability
to  pay  dividends  or  make  distributions,  loans  or  advances  to  us.  For  these  reasons,  we  may  not  have  access  to  any  assets  or  cash  flows  of  our
subsidiaries to make interest and principal payments on each series of the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes.

If  our  cash  flows  are  insufficient  to  fund  our  debt  and  other  obligations  and  we  are  unable  to  refinance  or  restructure  these  obligations  on
commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all,  we  could  face  substantial  liquidity  problems  and  may  be  forced  to  reduce  or  delay  investments  and  capital
expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement
any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other
obligations when due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, operating results, and financial condition
could be adversely affected.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from
fulfilling our obligations under the 2026 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, and Senior Notes.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately $4.28 billion in aggregate principal
amount of outstanding long-term indebtedness (excluding crypto asset borrowings), which includes $1.74 billion of our Senior Notes, $1.27 billion of our
2026 Convertible Notes, and $1.27 billion of our 2030 Convertible Notes.

Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations may:

• make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our 2026 Convertible

Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, Senior Notes, and our other obligations;

•

•

limit our ability to use our cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;

increase our cost of borrowing;

75

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;

limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and

increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates.

We provide secured loans to our customers, which exposes us to credit risks and may cause us to incur financial or reputational harm.

We provide commercial loans to qualified customers secured by their fiat or crypto asset holdings, including USDC, on our platform, which exposes
us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans. In addition, such activity results in us being subject to certain lending laws and regulations in
the applicable jurisdiction and as a result we may be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny. In the future we may enter into credit arrangements with
financial  institutions  to  obtain  more  capital. Any  termination  or  interruption  in  the  financial  institutions’  ability  to  lend  to  us  could  interrupt  our  ability  to
provide capital to qualified customers to the extent we rely on such credit lines to continue to offer or to grow such products. Further, our credit approval
process, pricing, loss forecasting, and scoring models may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers, or may be
otherwise  ineffective,  resulting  in  incorrect  approvals  or  denials  of  loans.  It  is  also  possible  that  loan  applicants  could  provide  false  or  incorrect
information. While we have procedures in place to manage our credit risk, such as conducting due diligence on our customers and running stress test
simulations to monitor and manage exposures, including any exposures resulting from loans collateralized with crypto assets, we remain subject to risks
associated with our borrowers’ creditworthiness and our approval process. Such risks are heightened following the 2022 Events.

Borrower loan loss rates may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our control and beyond the
control of individual borrowers. In particular, loss rates on loans may increase due to factors such as prevailing market conditions in the cryptoeconomy,
the price of Bitcoin and other crypto assets, which have experienced significant fluctuations, the amount of liquidity in the markets, and other factors.
Borrowers may seek protection under federal bankruptcy law or similar laws. If a borrower of a loan files for bankruptcy (or becomes the subject of an
involuntary petition), a stay may go into effect that will automatically put any pending collection actions on the loan on hold and prevent further collection
action absent bankruptcy court approval. The efficacy of our security interest in customer collateral is not guaranteed under applicable state law or the
Uniform Commercial Code and therefore we may be exposed to loss in the event of a customer default, even if we appear to be secured against such
default.  While  we  have  not  incurred  any  material  losses  to  date,  if  any  of  the  foregoing  events  were  to  occur,  our  reputation  and  relationships  with
borrowers, and our financial results, could be harmed. We intend to continue to explore other products, models, and structures for offering commercial
financing,  and  other  forms  of  credit  and  loan  products.  Some  of  those  models  or  structures  may  require,  or  be  deemed  to  require,  additional  data,
procedures, partnerships, licenses, regulatory approvals, or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed.

We are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks, refunds, or returns as a result of fraud or uncollectability that could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Certain of our products and services are paid for by electronic transfers from bank accounts, which exposes us to risks associated with returns and
insufficient funds. Furthermore, some of our products and services are paid for by credit and debit cards through payment processors, which exposes us
to risks associated with chargebacks and refunds. These risks could arise from fraud, misuse, unintentional use, settlement delay, insufficiency of funds,
or other activities. Also, criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities, such as counterfeiting and fraud. If we are
unable to

76

Table of Contents

collect such amounts from the customer, or if the customer refuses or is unable, due to bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us, we bear the loss
for the amount of the chargeback, refund, or return.

While we have policies and procedures to manage and mitigate these risks, we cannot be certain that such processes will be effective. Our failure to
limit chargebacks and fraudulent transactions could increase the number of returns, refunds, and chargebacks that we have to process. In addition, if the
number of returns, refunds, and chargebacks increases, card networks or our financial institution partners could require us to increase reserves, impose
penalties  on  us,  charge  additional  or  higher  fees,  or  terminate  their  relationships  with  us.  Failure  to  effectively  manage  risk  and  prevent  fraud  could
increase our chargeback, refund, and return losses or cause us to incur other liabilities. Increases in chargebacks, refunds, returns, or other liabilities
could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

We route orders through third-party trading venues in connection with our Coinbase Prime trading service. The loss or failure of any such
trading venues could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In connection with our Prime trading service, we routinely route customer orders to third-party exchanges or other trading venues. In connection with
these  activities,  we  generally  hold  cash  and  other  crypto  assets  with  such  third-party  exchanges  or  other  trading  venues  in  order  to  effect  customer
orders.  If  we  were  to  experience  a  disruption  in  our  access  to  these  third-party  exchanges  and  trading  venues,  our  Prime  trading  service  could  be
adversely affected to the extent that we are limited in our ability to execute order flow for our Prime customers. In addition, while we have policies and
procedures to help mitigate our risks related to routing orders through third-party trading venues, if any of these third-party trading venues experience
any technical, legal, regulatory, or other adverse events, such as shutdowns, delays, system failures, suspension of withdrawals, illiquidity, insolvency, or
loss of customer assets, we might not be able to fully recover the cash and other crypto assets that we have deposited with these third parties, and these
risks may be heightened following the 2022 Events. For example, in connection with the 2022 Events, we were not able to recover an immaterial amount
of cash deposited at FTX. As a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Any acquisitions and investments that we make could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in dilution to our
stockholders, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As part of our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions and evaluate opportunities for possible acquisitions, strategic investments, entries
into new businesses, joint ventures, and other transactions. We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of and investments in, among other
things,  specialized  employees  and  complementary  companies,  products,  services,  licenses,  or  technologies.  In  the  future,  the  pace  and  scale  of  our
acquisitions may increase and may include larger acquisitions than we have done historically. We also invest in companies and technologies, many of
which are private companies and technologies that are highly speculative in nature. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition
and investment candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or make investments on favorable terms, if at all. In some cases, the costs
of  such  acquisitions  and  investments  may  be  substantial,  and  there  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  receive  a  favorable  return  on  investment  for  our
acquisitions  and  investments.  We  have  and  may  in  the  future  be  required  to  write  off  acquisitions  or  investments.  Moreover,  our  previous  and  future
acquisitions  and  investments  may  not  achieve  our  goals,  and  any  future  acquisitions  and  investments  we  complete  could  be  viewed  negatively  by
customers,  developers,  advertisers,  or  investors.  In  addition,  if  we  fail  to  successfully  close  or  integrate  any  acquisitions,  or  integrate  the  products  or
technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Our  ability  to  acquire  and  integrate  companies,  products,  services,  licenses,  employees,  or  technologies  in  a  successful  manner  is  unproven.  Any
integration  process  may  require  significant  time  and  resources,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  manage  the  process  successfully,  including  successfully
securing regulatory approvals which may be required to close the transaction and to continue

77

Table of Contents

to  operate  the  target  firm’s  business  or  products  in  a  manner  that  is  useful  to  us.  We  may  not  successfully  evaluate  or  utilize  the  acquired  products,
services, technology, or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may have
to  pay  cash,  incur  debt,  or  issue  equity  securities  to  pay  for  any  such  acquisition,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and
financial condition. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders, which, depending
on  the  size  of  the  acquisition,  may  be  significant.  The  incurrence  of  indebtedness  would  result  in  increased  fixed  obligations  and  could  also  include
covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.

If we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand and reputation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Our  brand  and  reputation  are  key  assets  and  a  competitive  advantage.  Maintaining,  protecting,  and  enhancing  our  brand  depends  largely  on  the
success  of  our  marketing  efforts,  ability  to  provide  consistent,  high-quality,  and  secure  products,  services,  features,  and  support,  and  our  ability  to
successfully  secure,  maintain,  and  defend  our  rights  to  use  the  “Coinbase”  mark  and  other  trademarks  important  to  our  brand.  We  believe  that  the
importance of our brand will increase as competition further intensifies. Our brand and reputation could be harmed if we fail to achieve these objectives
or  if  our  public  image  were  to  be  tarnished  by  negative  publicity,  unexpected  events,  or  actions  by  third  parties.  Unfavorable  publicity  regarding,  for
example, our product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, privacy and data security practices, terms of service, employment matters,
the  use  of  our  products,  services,  or  supported  crypto  assets  for  illicit  or  objectionable  ends,  the  actions  of  our  customers,  or  the  actions  of  other
companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. Moreover, to the extent that we
acquire a company and maintain that acquired company’s separate brand, we could experience brand dilution or fail to retain positive impressions of our
own brand to the extent such impressions are instead attributed to the acquired company’s brand. In addition, because we are a founder-led company,
actions by, or unfavorable publicity about, Brian Armstrong, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, may adversely impact our brand and reputation.
Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size and engagement of our customers and could result in decreased revenue, which
could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Key business metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and change as our business evolves, and our
business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected by real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics or any
changes in metrics we disclose.

We regularly review our key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, and make
strategic decisions. These key business metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third-party.
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement at the time of reporting, there
are  inherent  challenges  in  such  measurements.  If  we  fail  to  maintain  an  effective  analytics  platform,  our  key  business  metrics  calculations  may  be
inaccurate, and we may not be able to identify those inaccuracies. Additionally, we may in the future calculate certain key business metrics using third-
party data. While we believe the third-party data we have used in the past or may use in the future is reliable, we have not independently verified and
may not in the future independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources and there can be no assurance that such
data  is  free  of  error. Any  inaccuracy  in  the  third-party  data  we  use  could  cause  us  to  overstate  or  understate  our  key  business  metrics.  We  regularly
review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we make adjustments to improve their accuracy. Additionally, our MTUs metric
is measured at a point in time and as our products and internal processes for calculating these metrics evolve over time, a previously reported number
could fluctuate. We generally will not update previously disclosed key business metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are immaterial.

78

Table of Contents

Our key business metrics may also be impacted by compliance or fraud-related bans, technical incidents, or false or spam accounts in existence on
our platform. We regularly deactivate fraudulent and spam accounts that violate our terms of service, and exclude these users from the calculation of our
key  business  metrics;  however,  we  may  not  succeed  in  identifying  and  removing  all  such  accounts  from  our  platform.  Additionally,  users  are  not
prohibited from having more than one account and our MTUs metric may overstate the number of unique customers who have registered an account on
our platform as one customer may register for, and use, multiple accounts with different email addresses, phone numbers, or usernames. Furthermore,
MTUs may overstate the number of unique consumers due to differences in product architecture or user behavior, which may cause MTUs to fluctuate.
For  example,  a  user  may  currently  have  an  account  on  the  Base App  (formerly  Coinbase  Wallet)  that  is  unlinked  to  their  registered  account  on  our
platform, but then choose to link these accounts in the future as our product offerings evolve. To the extent that the user had activity in both their Wallet
and their registered account in the measurement period, what was previously captured as two unique MTUs would now be counted as a single MTU. If
MTUs or our other key business metrics provide us with incorrect or incomplete information about users and their behavior, we may make inaccurate
conclusions about our business.

We may change our key business metrics from time to time, which may be perceived negatively. Given the rapid evolution of the crypto markets and
our revenue sources, we regularly evaluate whether our key business metrics remain meaningful indicators of the performance of our business. As a
result of these evaluations, in the past we have decided to make changes, and in the future may make additional changes, to our key business metrics,
including  eliminating  or  replacing  existing  metrics.  Further  if  investors  or  the  media  perceive  any  changes  to  our  key  business  metrics  disclosures
negatively, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our platform may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams. If our platform
is used to further such illegal activities, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our platform may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams. We or our partners
may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers, and it may be difficult or impossible for us to detect and avoid such
transactions  in  certain  circumstances. The  use  of  our  platform  for  illegal  or  improper  purposes  could  subject  us  to  claims,  individual  and  class  action
lawsuits,  and  government  and  regulatory  investigations,  prosecutions,  enforcement  actions,  inquiries,  or  requests  that  could  result  in  liability  and
reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activities that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and certain activities that
are at one time legal may in the future be deemed illegal in the same jurisdiction. As a result, there is significant uncertainty and cost associated with
detecting and monitoring transactions for compliance with local laws. In the event that a customer is found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently
violating the laws in any jurisdiction, we may be subject to governmental inquiries, enforcement actions, prosecuted, or otherwise held secondarily liable
for  aiding  or  facilitating  such  activities.  Changes  in  law  have  also  increased  the  penalties  for  money  transmitters  for  certain  illegal  activities,  and
government authorities may consider increased or additional penalties from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities
may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  money  transmitters,  including  us,  for  involvement  in  the  sale  of  infringing  or  allegedly  infringing  items.  Any
threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our
business.

Moreover, while fiat currencies can be used to facilitate illegal activities, crypto assets are relatively new and, in many jurisdictions, may be lightly
regulated or largely unregulated. Many types of crypto assets have characteristics, such as the speed with which digital currency transactions can be
conducted, the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple
jurisdictions, the irreversible nature of certain crypto asset transactions, and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions, that make crypto
assets  susceptible  to  use  in  illegal  activity.  U.S.  federal  and  state  and  foreign  regulatory  authorities  and  law  enforcement  agencies,  such  as  the
Department of Justice, SEC, CFTC, FTC, or the Internal Revenue

79

Table of Contents

Service (“IRS”), and various state securities and financial regulators have taken and continue to take legal action against persons and entities alleged to
be  engaged  in  fraudulent  schemes  or  other  illicit  activity  involving  crypto  assets.  We  also  support  crypto  assets  that  incorporate  privacy-enhancing
features,  and  may  from  time  to  time  support  additional  crypto  assets  with  similar  functionalities.  These  privacy-enhancing  crypto  assets  obscure  the
identities of sender and receiver, and may prevent law enforcement officials from tracing the source of funds on the blockchain. Facilitating transactions
in these crypto assets may cause us to be at increased risk of liability arising out of anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations.

While we believe that our risk management and compliance framework is designed to detect significant illicit activities conducted by our potential or
existing  customers,  we  cannot  ensure  that  we  will  be  able  to  detect  all  illegal  activity  on  our  platform.  Base  Chain  (formerly  Base),  an  open  source
permissionless L2 protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain developed by us, has been in the past, and may in the future, be a target for scam tokens or
other illegal activity. For example, in August 2023, a number of fraudulent tokens were identified and traded on Base Chain blockchain. As we continue to
develop  Base  Chain,  and  in  light  of  this  fraudulent  activity,  we  continue  to  invest  in  improving  our  security  processes,  including  through  our  in-house
blockchain monitoring capabilities, third-party tools for identifying malicious and out of pattern events, and the monitoring of contract source code and
bytecode on Base Chain against a database of known scam code patterns. While to date, such illegal or fraudulent activity on Base Chain has not had a
material impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows, future illegal activity could adversely affect our business, operating
results, financial condition or cash flows and our efforts to identify and remedy such illegal or fraudulent activity may not be successful. If our platform is
used to further such illegal activities, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation,
operating results, and financial condition.

Our ability to comply with applicable complex and evolving laws, regulations, and rules is largely dependent on the establishment, maintenance, and
scaling of our compliance, internal audit, and reporting systems to continuously keep pace with our customer activity and transaction volume, as well as
our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  compliance  and  other  risk  management  personnel.  While  we  have  devoted  significant  resources  to  develop
policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage our risks, and expect to continue to do so in the future, we cannot assure you that our policies
and procedures are and will always be effective or that we have been and will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are
or may be exposed in all market environments or against all types of risks, including unidentified or unanticipated risks. Our risk management policies
and procedures rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. Some of our methods for
managing  risk  are  discretionary  by  nature  and  are  based  on  internally  developed  controls  and  observed  historical  market  behavior,  and  also  involve
reliance on standard industry practices. These methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements,
which may be significantly greater than historical fluctuations in the market. Further, as a result of the 2022 Events or similar market disruptions in the
future,  we  may  reevaluate  our  risk  management  policies  and  procedures.  Accordingly,  in  the  future,  we  may  identify  gaps  in  such  policies  and
procedures or existing gaps may become higher risk, and may require significant resources and management attention. Our risk management policies
and procedures also may not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if our testing and quality control practices are not effective in preventing
failures. In addition, we may elect to adjust our risk management policies and procedures to allow for an increase in risk tolerance, which could expose
us to the risk of greater losses.

Regulators periodically review our compliance with our own policies and procedures and with a variety of laws and regulations. We have received in
the  past  and  may  from  time  to  time  receive  additional  examination  reports  citing  violations  of  rules  and  regulations  and  inadequacies  in  existing
compliance  programs,  and  requiring  us  to  enhance  certain  practices  with  respect  to  our  compliance  program,  including  due  diligence,  training,
monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. If we fail to comply with these,

80

Table of Contents

or do not adequately remediate certain findings, regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business, including,
but  not  limited  to,  delaying,  denying,  withdrawing,  or  conditioning  approval  of  certain  products  and  services.  In  addition,  regulators  have  broad
enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease and desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our business activities, or revoke our licenses.
We face significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activities, and will continue to face the risk of
significant  intervention  by  regulatory  authorities  in  the  future.  In  the  case  of  non-compliance  or  alleged  non-compliance,  we  could  be  subject  to
investigations and proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages which can be significant.
Any  of  these  outcomes  would  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  brand  and  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Some  of  these
outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.

We hold certain investments in DeFi protocols and may suffer losses if they do not function as expected.

We hold investments in various DeFi protocols. These protocols achieve their investment purposes through self-executing smart contracts that allow
users to invest crypto assets in a pool from which other users can borrow without requiring an intermediate party to facilitate these transactions. These
investments  earn  interest  to  the  investor  based  on  the  rates  at  which  borrowers  repay  the  loan,  and  can  generally  be  withdrawn  with  no  restrictions.
However, these DeFi protocols are subject to various risks, including uncertain regulatory and compliance conditions in large markets such as the United
States,  the  risk  that  the  underlying  smart  contract  is  insecure,  the  risk  that  borrowers  may  default  and  the  investor  will  not  be  able  to  recover  its
investment, the risk that any underlying collateral may experience significant volatility, and the risk of certain core developers with protocol administration
rights  can  make  unauthorized  or  harmful  changes  to  the  underlying  smart  contract.  If  any  of  these  risks  materialize,  our  investments  in  these  DeFi
protocols may be adversely impacted.

We may suffer losses due to abrupt and erratic market movements.

The crypto asset market has been characterized by significant volatility and unexpected price movements, and has experienced significant declines
in the past. Certain crypto assets may become more volatile and less liquid in a very short period of time, which was the case following the 2022 Events,
resulting in market prices being subject to erratic and abrupt market movement, which could harm our business. For instance, abrupt changes in volatility
or market movement can lead to extreme pressures on our platform and infrastructure that can lead to inadvertent suspension of services across parts of
the  platform  or  the  entire  platform.  As  a  result,  from  time  to  time  we  experience  outages.  For  example,  in  2024,  we  experienced  approximately  14
outages,  with  an  average  outage  duration  of  58.6  minutes.  Outages  can  lead  to  increased  customer  service  expense,  can  cause  customer  loss  and
reputational damage, result in inquiries and actions by regulators, and can lead to other damages for which we may be responsible.

Risks Related to Crypto Assets

Due to unfamiliarity and some negative publicity associated with crypto asset platforms, confidence or interest in crypto asset platforms may
decline.

Crypto asset platforms are relatively new. Many of our competitors are unlicensed, unregulated, operate without supervision by any governmental
authorities,  and  do  not  provide  the  public  with  significant  information  regarding  their  ownership  structure,  management  team,  corporate  practices,
cybersecurity,  and  regulatory  compliance.  As  a  result,  customers  and  the  general  public  may  lose  confidence  or  interest  in  crypto  asset  platforms,
including regulated platforms like ours.

Since the inception of the cryptoeconomy, numerous crypto asset platforms have been sued, investigated, or shut down due to fraud, manipulative
practices, business failure, and security breaches. In many of these instances, customers of these platforms were not compensated or made whole for
their losses. Larger platforms like us are more appealing targets for hackers and malware, and may also be

81

Table of Contents

more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement actions. For example, in February 2014, Mt. Gox, the then largest crypto asset platform worldwide,
filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan after an estimated 700,000 Bitcoins were stolen from its wallets. In May 2019, Binance, one of the world’s largest
platforms, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $40 million, and in February 2021, Bitfinex settled a long-running legal dispute with the State
of New York related to Bitfinex’s alleged misuse of over $800 million of customer assets. The 2022 Events resulted in a loss of confidence in the broader
cryptoeconomy, adverse reputational impact to crypto asset platforms, increased negative publicity surrounding crypto more broadly, heightened scrutiny
by regulators and lawmakers and a call for increased regulations of crypto assets and crypto asset platforms.

In  addition,  there  have  been  reports  that  a  significant  amount  of  crypto  asset  trading  volume  on  crypto  asset  platforms  is  fabricated  and  false  in
nature,  with  a  specific  focus  on  unregulated  platforms  located  outside  the  United  States.  Such  reports  may  indicate  that  the  market  for  crypto  asset
platform activities is significantly smaller than otherwise understood.

Negative perception, a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the cryptoeconomy, and the closure or temporary shutdown of crypto asset
platforms  due  to  fraud,  business  failure,  hackers  or  malware,  or  government  mandated  regulation,  and  associated  losses  suffered  by  customers  may
continue to reduce confidence or interest in the cryptoeconomy and result in greater volatility of the prices of assets, including significant depreciation in
value. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and our customers’ perception of us, including decreased use of our platform
and loss of customer demand for our products and services.

Depositing and withdrawing crypto assets into and from our platforms involve risks, which could result in loss of customer assets, customer
disputes and other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In order to own, transfer and use a crypto asset on its underlying blockchain network, a person must have a private and public key pair associated
with a network address, commonly referred to as a “wallet.” Each wallet is associated with a unique “public key” and “private key” pair, each of which is a
string of alphanumerical characters. To deposit crypto assets held by a customer onto our platforms, a customer must “sign” a transaction that consists of
the private key of the wallet from where the customer is transferring crypto assets, the public key of a wallet that we control which we provide to the
customer,  and  broadcast  the  deposit  transaction  onto  the  underlying  blockchain  network.  Similarly,  to  withdraw  crypto  assets  from  our  platforms,  the
customer  must  provide  us  with  the  public  key  of  the  wallet  that  the  crypto  assets  are  to  be  transferred  to,  and  we  would  be  required  to  “sign”  a
transaction  authorizing  the  transfer.  In  addition,  some  crypto  networks  require  additional  information  to  be  provided  in  connection  with  any  transfer  of
crypto assets to or from our platforms. A number of errors can occur in the process of depositing or withdrawing crypto assets into or from our platforms,
such  as  typos,  mistakes,  or  the  failure  to  include  the  information  required  by  the  blockchain  network.  For  instance,  a  user  may  incorrectly  enter  our
wallet’s  public  key  or  the  desired  recipient’s  public  key  when  depositing  and  withdrawing  from  our  platforms,  respectively.  Alternatively,  a  user  may
transfer  crypto  assets  to  a  wallet  address  that  the  user  does  not  own,  control  or  hold  the  private  keys  to.  In  addition,  each  wallet  address  is  only
compatible with the underlying blockchain network on which it is created. For instance, a Bitcoin wallet address can only be used to send and receive
Bitcoins. If any Ethereum or other crypto assets are sent to a Bitcoin wallet address, or if any of the foregoing errors occur, all of the customer’s sent
crypto assets will be permanently and irretrievably lost with no means of recovery. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter similar
incidents  with  our  customers.  Such  incidents  could  result  in  customer  disputes,  damage  to  our  brand  and  reputation,  legal  claims  against  us,  and
financial liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Moreover, we hold customer assets one-to-one at all times and we have procedures to process redemptions and withdrawals expeditiously, following
the terms of the applicable user agreements. We have not experienced excessive redemptions or withdrawals, or prolonged suspended redemptions or
withdrawals, of crypto assets to date. However, similar to traditional financial institutions, we may

82

experience temporary process-related withdrawal delays. For example, we, and traditional financial institutions, may experience such delays if there is a
significant volume of withdrawal requests that is vastly beyond anticipated levels. This does not mean we cannot or will not satisfy withdrawals, but this
may  mean  a  temporary  delay  in  satisfying  withdrawal  requests,  which  we  still  expect  to  be  satisfied  within  the  withdrawal  timelines  set  forth  in  the
applicable user agreements or otherwise communicated by us. To the extent we have process-related delays, even if brief or due to blockchain network
congestion  or  heightened  redemption  activity,  and  within  the  terms  of  an  applicable  user  agreement  or  otherwise  communicated  by  us,  we  may
experience increased customer complaints and damage to our brand and reputation and face additional regulatory scrutiny, any of which could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

A temporary or permanent blockchain “fork” to any supported crypto asset could adversely affect our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

Blockchain  protocols,  including  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum,  are  open  source.  Any  user  can  download  the  software,  modify  it,  and  then  propose  that
Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other blockchain protocols users and miners adopt the modification. When a modification is introduced and a substantial majority of
users  and  miners  consent  to  the  modification,  the  change  is  implemented  and  the  Bitcoin,  Ethereum  or  other  blockchain  protocol  networks,  as
applicable,  remain  uninterrupted.  However,  if  less  than  a  substantial  majority  of  users  and  miners  consent  to  the  proposed  modification,  and  the
modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a “fork” (i.e., “split”) of the impacted
blockchain protocol network and respective blockchain, with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software.
The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two parallel versions of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other blockchain protocol network, as applicable,
running simultaneously, but with each split network’s crypto asset lacking interchangeability.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols have been subject to “forks” that resulted in the creation of new networks, including Bitcoin Cash ABC, Bitcoin
Cash  SV,  Bitcoin  Diamond,  Bitcoin  Gold,  Ethereum  Classic,  EthereumPOW,  and  others.  Some  of  these  forks  have  caused  fragmentation  among
platforms as to the correct naming convention for forked crypto assets. Due to the lack of a central registry or rulemaking body, no single entity has the
ability  to  dictate  the  nomenclature  of  forked  crypto  assets,  causing  disagreements  and  a  lack  of  uniformity  among  platforms  on  the  nomenclature  of
forked crypto assets, and which results in further confusion to customers as to the nature of assets they hold on platforms. In addition, several of these
forks were contentious and as a result, participants in certain communities may harbor ill will towards other communities. As a result, certain community
members may take actions that adversely impact the use, adoption, and price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any of their forked alternatives.

Furthermore,  hard  forks  can  lead  to  new  security  concerns.  For  instance,  when  the  Ethereum  and  Ethereum  Classic  networks  split  in  July  2016,
replay  attacks,  in  which  transactions  from  one  network  were  rebroadcast  on  the  other  network  to  achieve  “double-spending,”  plagued  platforms  that
traded  Ethereum  through  at  least  October  2016,  resulting  in  significant  losses  to  some  crypto  asset  platforms.  Similar  replay  attacks  occurred  in
connection with the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash SV network split in November 2018. Another possible result of a hard fork is an inherent decrease in
the level of security due to the splitting of some mining power across networks, making it easier for a malicious actor to exceed 50% of the mining power
of that network, thereby making crypto assets that rely on proof-of-work more susceptible to attack, as has occurred with Ethereum Classic.

We  do  not  believe  that  we  are  required  to  support  any  fork  or  airdrop  or  provide  the  benefit  of  any  forked  or  airdropped  crypto  asset  to  our
customers. However, we have in the past and may in the future continue to be subject to claims by customers arguing that they are entitled to receive
certain forked or airdropped crypto assets by virtue of crypto assets that they hold with us. If any customers succeed on a claim that they are entitled to
receive the benefits of a forked or airdropped crypto asset that we do not or are unable to support, we may be required to pay significant damages, fines
or other fees to compensate customers for their losses.

Future forks may occur at any time. A fork can lead to a disruption of networks and our information technology systems, cybersecurity attacks, replay
attacks, or security weaknesses, any of which can further lead to temporary or even permanent loss of our and our customers’ assets. Such disruption
and loss could cause us to be exposed to liability, even in circumstances where we have no intention of supporting an asset compromised by a fork.

We currently support, and expect to continue to support, certain smart contract-based crypto assets. If the underlying smart contracts for
these crypto assets do not operate as expected, they could lose value and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

We currently support, and expect to continue to support, various crypto assets that represent units of value on smart contracts deployed on a third-
party blockchain. Smart contracts are programs that store and transfer value and execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Since smart
contracts typically cannot be stopped or reversed, vulnerabilities in their programming and design can have damaging effects. For instance, in April 2018,
a batch overflow bug was found in many Ethereum-based ERC20-compatible smart contract tokens that allowed hackers to create a large number of
smart  contract  tokens,  causing  multiple  crypto  asset  platforms  worldwide  to  shut  down  ERC20-compatible  token  trading.  Similarly,  in  March  2020,  a
design flaw in the MakerDAO smart contract caused forced liquidations of crypto assets at significantly discounted prices, resulting in millions of dollars
of losses to users who had deposited crypto assets into the smart contract. If any such vulnerabilities or flaws come to fruition, smart contract-based
crypto  assets,  including  those  held  by  our  customers  on  our  platforms,  may  suffer  negative  publicity,  be  exposed  to  security  vulnerabilities,  decline
significantly in value, and lose liquidity over a short period of time.

In some cases, smart contracts can be controlled by one or more “admin keys” or users with special privileges, or “super users.” These users have
the ability to unilaterally make changes to the smart contract, enable or disable features on the smart contract, change how the smart contract receives
external inputs and data, and make other changes to the smart contract. For smart contracts that hold a pool of reserves, these users may also be able
to extract funds from the pool, liquidate assets held in the pool, or take other actions that decrease the value of the assets held by the smart contract in
reserves. Even for crypto assets that have adopted a decentralized governance mechanism, such as smart contracts that are governed by the holders of
a governance token, such governance tokens can be concentrated in the hands of a small group of core community members, who would be able to
make similar changes unilaterally to the smart contract. If any such super user or group of core members unilaterally make adverse changes to a smart
contract, the design, functionality, features and value of the smart contract, its related crypto assets may be harmed. In addition, assets held by the smart
contract in reserves may be stolen, misused, burnt, locked up or otherwise become unusable and irrecoverable. These super users can also become
targets of hackers and malicious attackers. If an attacker is able to access or obtain the super user privileges of a smart contract, or if a smart contract’s
super  users  or  core  community  members  take  actions  that  adversely  affect  the  smart  contract,  our  customers  who  hold  and  transact  in  the  affected
crypto  assets  may  experience  decreased  functionality  and  value  of  the  applicable  crypto  assets,  up  to  and  including  a  total  loss  of  the  value  of  such
crypto assets. Although we do not control these smart contracts, any such events could cause customers to seek damages against us for their losses,
result in reputational damage to us, or in other ways adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

From time to time, we may encounter technical issues in connection with the integration of supported crypto assets and changes and
upgrades to their underlying networks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In order to support any supported crypto asset, a variety of front and back-end technical and development work is required to implement our wallet,
custody, trading, staking and other solutions for our customers, and to integrate such supported crypto asset with our existing technical infrastructure.
For certain crypto assets, a significant amount of development work is required and there is no guarantee that

84

Table of Contents

we  will  be  able  to  integrate  successfully  with  any  existing  or  future  crypto  asset.  In  addition,  such  integration  may  introduce  software  errors  or
weaknesses  into  our  platform,  including  our  existing  infrastructure.  Even  if  such  integration  is  initially  successful,  any  number  of  technical  changes,
software  upgrades,  soft  or  hard  forks,  cybersecurity  incidents,  or  other  changes  to  the  underlying  blockchain  network  may  occur  from  time  to  time,
causing incompatibility, technical issues, disruptions, or security weaknesses to our platform. If we are unable to identify, troubleshoot and resolve any
such issues successfully, we may no longer be able to support such crypto asset, our customers’ assets may be frozen or lost, the security of our hot,
warm,  or  cold  wallets  may  be  compromised,  and  our  platform  and  technical  infrastructure  may  be  affected,  all  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

If miners or validators of any supported crypto asset demand high transaction fees, our business, operating results, and financial condition
could be adversely affected.

We charge blockchain transaction fees when a customer sends certain crypto assets from their Coinbase account to a non-Coinbase account. We
estimate the blockchain transaction fee based on the cost that we will incur to process the withdrawal transaction on the underlying blockchain network.
In  addition,  we  also  pay  blockchain  transaction  fees  when  we  move  crypto  assets  for  various  operational  purposes,  such  as  when  we  transfer  crypto
assets between our hot and cold wallets, for which we do not charge our customers. However, blockchain transaction fees have been and may continue
to be unpredictable. If the block rewards for miners on any blockchain network are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, miners may demand higher
transaction  fees,  or  collude  to  reject  low  transaction  fees  and  force  users  to  pay  higher  fees.  Although  we  generally  attempt  to  pass  blockchain
transaction fees relating to customer withdrawals through to our customers, we have in the past incurred, and expect to incur from time to time, losses
associated  with  the  payment  of  blockchain  transaction  fees  in  excess  of  what  we  charge  our  customers,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Future developments regarding the treatment of crypto assets for U.S. and foreign tax purposes could adversely affect our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Due to the new and evolving nature of crypto assets and the absence of comprehensive legal and tax guidance with respect to crypto asset products
and transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. and foreign tax treatment of transactions involving crypto assets, such as the purchase and sale of
crypto assets on our platform, as well as the provision of blockchain rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and
it  is  unclear  whether,  when  and  what  guidance  may  be  issued  in  the  future  on  the  treatment  of  crypto  asset  transactions  for  U.S.  and  foreign  tax
purposes.

In 2014, the IRS released Notice 2014-21, discussing certain aspects of “virtual currency” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in particular,
stating that such virtual currency (i) is “property,” (ii) is not “currency” for purposes of the rules relating to foreign currency gain or loss, and (iii) may be
held as a capital asset. From time to time, the IRS has released other guidance relating to the tax treatment of virtual currency or crypto assets reflecting
the IRS’s position on certain issues. The IRS has not addressed many other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of crypto assets
and related transactions.

There  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  the  timing,  character,  and  amount  of  income  inclusions  for  various  crypto  asset  transactions
including,  but  not  limited  to  lending  and  borrowing  crypto  assets,  staking,  and  other  crypto  asset  incentives  and  products  that  we  offer. Although  we
believe our treatment of crypto asset transactions for federal income tax purposes is consistent with existing positions from the IRS and/or existing U.S.
federal income tax principles, because of the rapidly evolving nature of crypto asset innovations and the increasing variety and complexity of crypto asset
transactions and products, it is possible the IRS and various U.S. states may disagree with our treatment of certain crypto asset offerings for U.S. tax
purposes,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  customers  and  the  vitality  of  our  business.  Similar  uncertainties  exist  in  the  foreign  markets  in  which  we
operate with respect to direct and

85

Table of Contents

indirect taxes, and these uncertainties and potential adverse interpretations of tax law could impact the amount of tax we and our non-U.S. customers
are required to pay, and the vitality of our platforms outside of the United States.

There can be no assurance that the IRS, U.S. state revenue agencies, or other foreign tax authorities, will not alter their respective positions with
respect  to  crypto  assets  in  the  future  or  that  a  court  would  uphold  the  treatment  set  forth  in  existing  positions.  It  also  is  unclear  what  additional  tax
authority positions, regulations, or legislation may be issued in the future on the treatment of existing crypto asset transactions and future crypto asset
innovations  under  U.S.  federal,  U.S.  state,  or  foreign  tax  law. Any  such  developments  could  result  in  adverse  tax  consequences  for  holders  of  crypto
assets  and  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  value  of  crypto  assets  and  the  broader  crypto  assets  markets.  Future  technological  and  operational
developments  that  may  arise  with  respect  to  crypto  assets  may  increase  the  uncertainty  with  respect  to  the  treatment  of  crypto  assets  for  U.S.  and
foreign tax purposes. The uncertainty regarding tax treatment of crypto asset transactions impacts our customers, and could impact our business, both
domestically and abroad.

Our tax information reporting obligations with respect to crypto transactions may be subject to further scrutiny in light of changes made to
the U.S. and global broker reporting regime for tax reporting.

In November 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”), providing that brokers would be responsible for
reporting to the IRS the transactions of their customers in digital assets, including transfers to other exchanges or to digital asset wallets not connected
to any exchange. On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released final regulations and issued other administrative guidance on
tax  information  reporting  for  digital  assets  (collectively,  the  “Final  Regulations”)  that  will  be  applicable,  in  certain  cases  starting  January  1,  2025. The
Final Regulations introduced new rules related to our tax reporting and withholding obligations on our customer transactions.

Although we believe we are compliant with U.S. tax reporting and withholding requirements with respect to our customers’ crypto asset transactions,
our compliance with the Final Regulations, including but not limited to U.S. onboarding requirements through Forms W-9 and W-8, backup withholding,
non-resident alien withholding, and Form 1099 and Form 1042-S reporting obligations, may be subject to scrutiny and may be challenged. There is a risk
that we may not have proper processes and procedures necessary to comply with the Final Regulations, may not be able to interpret the IIJA, the Final
Regulations, or the administrative guidance correctly, or may not be able to build systems within the required timelines to ensure compliance for certain
customers or transactions. If the IRS determines that we are not in compliance with our tax reporting or withholding obligations on customer transactions,
significant  taxes  and  penalties  may  be  imposed,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  position.  The  Final  Regulations  will  require  us  to  invest
substantially in new compliance processes and procedures, which also could adversely affect our financial position. Further, the IRS may issue additional
guidance  in  the  future  with  respect  to  tax  reporting  and  withholding  obligations,  which  could  impose  additional  burdens  on  us  and  result  in  significant
taxes and penalties that could adversely affect our financial position.

Similarly,  new  rules  for  reporting  crypto  assets  under  the  global  “common  reporting  standard”  (CRS)  as  well  as  under  the  “crypto-asset  reporting
framework” (CARF) will be implemented on our international operations, creating new obligations and a need to invest in new onboarding and reporting
infrastructure. Such rules are under discussion by the member and observer states of the “Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development”
and  by  the  European  Commission  on  behalf  of  the  member  states  of  the  European  Union.  These  new  rules  may  give  rise  to  potential  liabilities  or
disclosure requirements for prior customer arrangements and new rules that affect how we onboard our customers and report their transactions to taxing
authorities.  Additionally,  the  European  Union  has  issued  a  directive,  commonly  referred  to  as  “CESOP”  (the  Central  Electronic  System  of  Payment
information), which requires payment service providers in the European Union to report cross-border fiat transactions to taxing authorities on a quarterly
basis. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with the above or any other tax and

86

Table of Contents

financial regulations that apply to our operations could harm our business and adversely affect our financial position.

The nature of our business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules, and there is limited guidance from accounting
standard setting bodies on certain topics. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes, our operating results could
fluctuate.

The  accounting  rules  and  regulations  that  we  must  comply  with  are  complex  and  subject  to  interpretation  by  the  Financial Accounting  Standards
Board (the “FASB”), the SEC, and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. Recent actions and public
comments  from  the  FASB  and  the  SEC  have  focused  on  the  integrity  of  financial  reporting  and  internal  controls  and  many  companies’  accounting
policies are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. Further, there has been limited precedent for the financial accounting of
crypto assets and related valuation and revenue recognition. Moreover, a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on
our reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For
example, in December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (ASU 2023-
08): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”), which represents a significant change in how entities that hold crypto assets will
account for certain of those holdings. Previously, crypto assets held were accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which required us
to  measure  crypto  assets  at  cost  less  impairment.  Effective  as  of  January  1,  2024,  we  adopted ASU  2023-08,  which  requires  us  to  measure  crypto
assets  held  at  fair  value  at  each  reporting  date,  with  fair  value  gains  and  losses  recognized  through  Net  income.  Fair  value  gains  and  losses  can
increase the volatility of our net income, especially if the underlying crypto asset market is volatile. Additionally, on March 31, 2022, the staff of the SEC
issued  Staff Accounting  Bulletin  (“SAB”)  No.  121  (“SAB  121”),  which  represented  a  significant  change  regarding  how  a  company  safeguarding  crypto
assets held for its platform users reports such crypto assets on its balance sheet and required retrospective application as of January 1, 2022. In January
2025, the staff of the SEC issued SAB No. 122 (“SAB 122”), which rescinds the previously-issued interpretive guidance included within SAB 121. We
have adopted SAB 122 as of December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis.

Uncertainties  in  or  changes  to  regulatory  or  financial  accounting  standards  could  result  in  the  need  to  change  our  accounting  methods  and  may
retroactively affect previously reported results and impair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could adversely affect our
financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Privacy Matters

The cryptoeconomy is novel. As a result, policymakers are just beginning to consider what a regulatory regime for crypto would look like and
the elements that would serve as the foundation for such a regime. This less developed consideration of crypto may harm our ability to
effectively react to proposed legislation and regulation of crypto assets or crypto asset platforms adverse to our business.

As  crypto  assets  have  grown  in  both  popularity  and  market  size,  various  U.S.  federal,  state,  and  local  and  foreign  governmental  organizations,
consumer  agencies  and  public  advocacy  groups  have  been  examining  the  operations  of  crypto  networks,  users  and  platforms,  with  a  focus  on  how
crypto assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities, fund criminal or terrorist enterprises, and simultaneously how to ensure the safety
and soundness of platforms and other service providers that hold crypto assets for users. Many of these entities have called for heightened regulatory
oversight, and have issued consumer advisories describing the risks posed by crypto assets to users and investors.

Competitors, including traditional financial services, have spent years cultivating professional relationships with relevant policymakers on behalf of

their industry so that those policymakers may

87

Table of Contents

understand  that  industry,  the  current  legal  landscape  affecting  that  industry,  and  the  specific  policy  proposals  that  could  be  implemented  in  order  to
responsibly develop that industry. The lobbyists working for these competitors have similarly spent years developing and working to implement strategies
to advance these industries. Members of the cryptoeconomy have started to engage policymakers directly and with the help of external advisors and
lobbyists. For example, in order to advance our mission, in February 2022 we launched our Coinbase Innovation Political Action Committee to support
crypto-forward  political  candidates  and  initiatives.  Further,  in  December  2023,  we  together  with  a  number  of  other  crypto  and  blockchain  market
participants  supported  the  launch  of  the  Fairshake  Political  Action  Committee  to  support  political  candidates  in  the  2024  U.S.  presidential  and
congressional elections who support crypto and blockchain innovation and responsible regulation. However, these efforts to educate policymakers and
advocate for sensible regulation are nascent compared to more established industries, and may be perceived unfavorably by investors and the public
and have an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. As a result, new laws and regulations may be proposed and adopted in the United States and
internationally,  or  existing  laws  and  regulations  may  be  interpreted  in  new  ways,  that  harm  the  cryptoeconomy  or  crypto  asset  platforms,  which  could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our  Condensed  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  may  not  contain  sufficient  amounts  or  types  of  regulatory  capital  to  meet  the  changing
requirements of our various regulators worldwide, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We are required to possess sufficient financial soundness and strength to adequately support our regulated subsidiaries. We may from time to time
incur  indebtedness  and  other  obligations  which  could  make  it  more  difficult  to  meet  these  capitalization  requirements  or  any  additional  regulatory
requirements. In addition, although we are not a bank holding company for purposes of United States law or the law of any other jurisdiction, as a global
provider  of  financial  services  and  in  light  of  the  changing  regulatory  environment  in  various  jurisdictions,  we  could  become  subject  to  new  capital
requirements introduced or imposed by the United States and international regulators. Any change or increase in these regulatory requirements could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As a financial institution licensed to, among other things, engage in money transmission in the United States, to conduct virtual currency business
activity  in  New  York,  and  issue  electronic  money  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  European  Union,  we  are  subject  to  strict  rules  governing  how  we
manage and hold customer fiat currency, stablecoins, and crypto assets. We maintain complex treasury operations to manage and move customer fiat
currency and crypto assets across our platforms and to comply with regulatory requirements. However, it is possible we may experience errors in fiat
currency  and  crypto  asset  handling,  accounting,  and  regulatory  reporting  that  lead  us  to  be  out  of  compliance  with  these  requirements.  In  addition,
regulators may increase the amount of capital reserves that we are required to maintain for our operations, as has happened in the past, which may lead
to sanctions, penalties, changes to our business operations, or the revocation of licenses. Frequent launch of new products and services, margin trading,
lending functions, and the addition of new payment rails increase these risks.

Many  of  the  crypto  assets  in  which  we  facilitate  trading  are  subject  to  regulatory  authority  by  the  CFTC.  Any  fraudulent  or  manipulative
activity in a crypto asset occurring on our platform could subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, regulatory enforcement, and litigation.

The CFTC has stated and judicial decisions involving CFTC enforcement actions have confirmed that at least some crypto assets, including Bitcoin,
ether, litecoin, and stablecoins, such as USDC, USDT and BUSD, fall within the definition of a “commodity” under the U.S. Commodities Exchange Act of
1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, the CFTC has general enforcement authority to police against manipulation and fraud in at least some spot crypto asset
markets. From time to time, manipulation, fraud, and other forms of improper trading by market participants have resulted in, and may in the future result
in,  CFTC  investigations,  inquiries,  enforcement  action,  and  similar  actions  by  other  regulators,  government  agencies,  and  civil  litigation.  Such
investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions, and litigation may cause us to incur substantial costs and could result in negative publicity.

88

Certain transactions in crypto assets may constitute “retail commodity transactions” subject to regulation by the CFTC as futures contracts.
If crypto asset transactions we facilitate are deemed to be such retail commodity transactions, we would be subject to additional regulatory
requirements,  licenses  and  approvals,  and  potentially  face  regulatory  enforcement,  civil  liability,  and  significant  increased  compliance  and
operational costs.

Any transaction in a commodity, including a crypto asset, entered into with or offered to retail investors using leverage, margin, or other financing
arrangements  (a  “retail  commodity  transaction”)  is  subject  to  CFTC  regulation  as  a  futures  contract  unless  such  transaction  results  in  actual  delivery
within 28 days. The meaning of “actual delivery” has been the subject of commentary and litigation, and the CFTC has adopted interpretive guidance
addressing the “actual delivery” of a crypto asset. To the extent that crypto asset transactions that we facilitate or facilitated are deemed retail commodity
transactions, including pursuant to current or subsequent rulemaking or guidance by the CFTC, we may be subject to additional regulatory requirements
and oversight, and we could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions if we do not or did not at a relevant time possess appropriate registrations.
The  CFTC  has  previously  brought  enforcement  actions  against  entities  engaged  in  retail  commodity  transactions  without  appropriate  registrations,  as
well as recent enforcement settled orders against developers of decentralized platforms.

Particular  crypto  assets  or  transactions  therein  could  be  deemed  “commodity  interests”  (e.g.,  futures,  options,  swaps)  or  security-based
swaps subject to regulation by the CFTC or SEC, respectively. If a crypto asset that we facilitate trading in is deemed a commodity interest or
a  security-based  swap,  we  would  be  subject  to  additional  regulatory  requirements,  registrations  and  approvals,  and  potentially  face
regulatory enforcement, civil liability, and significant increased compliance and operational costs.

Commodity interests, as such term is defined by the CEA and CFTC rules and regulations, are subject to more extensive supervisory oversight by
the CFTC, including registrations of entities engaged in, and platforms offering, commodity interest transactions. This CFTC authority extends to crypto
asset futures contracts and swaps, including transactions that are based on current and future prices of crypto assets and indices of crypto assets. To
the extent that a crypto asset in which we facilitate or facilitated trading or transactions in a crypto asset which we facilitate or facilitated are deemed to
fall within the definition of a commodity interest, including pursuant to subsequent rulemaking or guidance by the CFTC, we may be subject to additional
regulatory  requirements  and  oversight  and  could  be  subject  to  judicial  or  administrative  sanctions  if  we  do  not  or  did  not  at  a  relevant  time  possess
appropriate registrations as an exchange (for example, as a designated contract market for trading futures or options on futures, or as a swaps execution
facility  for  trading  swaps)  or  as  a  registered  intermediary  (for  example,  as  a  futures  commission  merchant  or  introducing  broker).  Such  actions  could
result in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as civil monetary penalties, fines, and disgorgement, as well as reputational harm. The CFTC has
previously brought enforcement actions against entities engaged in crypto asset activities for failure to obtain appropriate exchange, execution facility
and intermediary registrations.

Furthermore,  the  CFTC  and  the  SEC  have  jointly  adopted  regulations  defining  “security-based  swaps,”  which  include  swaps  based  on  single
securities and narrow-based indices of securities. If a crypto asset is deemed to be a security, certain transactions referencing that crypto asset could
constitute a security-based swap. A crypto asset or transaction therein that is based on or references a security or index of securities, whether or not
such securities are themselves crypto assets, could also constitute a security-based swap. To the extent that a crypto asset in which we facilitate or have
facilitated trading or transactions in a crypto asset which we facilitate or have facilitated are deemed to fall within the definition of a security-based swap,
including pursuant to subsequent rulemaking or guidance by the CFTC or SEC, we may be subject to additional regulatory requirements and oversight
by the SEC and could be subject to judicial or administrative sanctions if we do not or did not a relevant time possess appropriate registrations as an
exchange (for example, as a security-based swaps execution facility) or as a registered intermediary (for example, as a security-based swap dealer or
broker-dealer). This could result

89

Table of Contents

in injunctions, cease and desist orders, as well as civil monetary penalties, fines, and disgorgement, as well as reputational harm.

We obtain and process a large amount of sensitive customer data. Any real or perceived improper use of, disclosure of, or access to such
data could harm our reputation, as well as adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We  obtain  and  process  large  amounts  of  sensitive  data,  including  personal  data  related  to  our  customers  and  their  transactions,  such  as  their
names,  addresses,  social  security  numbers,  visa  information,  copies  of  government-issued  identification,  facial  recognition  data  (from  scanning  of
photographs  for  identity  verification),  trading  data,  tax  identification,  and  bank  account  information.  We  face  risks,  including  to  our  reputation,  in  the
handling  and  protection  of  this  data,  and  these  risks  will  increase  as  our  business  continues  to  expand,  including  through  our  acquisition  of,  and
investment  in,  other  companies  and  technologies.  Federal,  state,  and  international  laws  and  regulations  governing  privacy,  data  protection,  and  e-
commerce transactions require us to safeguard our customers’, employees’, and service providers’ personal data.

We  have  administrative,  technical,  and  physical  security  measures  and  controls  in  place  and  maintain  a  robust  information  security  program.
However, our security measures, those of our vendors or service providers, or the security measures of companies we acquire, may be inadequate or
breached as a result of third-party action, employee or service provider error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, trickery,
advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or otherwise, and, as a result, someone may
be  able  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to  sensitive  information,  including  personal  data,  on  our  systems.  We  could  be  the  target  of  a  cybersecurity
incident, which could result in harm to our reputation and financial losses. Additionally, our customers have been and could be targeted in cybersecurity
incidents like an account takeover, which could result in harm to our reputation and financial losses. For example, as previously disclosed on a Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 15, 2025, a threat actor improperly obtained information about certain customer accounts and internal
documentation, and used that information for social-engineering attempts. No passwords or private keys were compromised as a result of this incident.
Our investigation of this incident remains ongoing and we continue to face risks related to this incident, including harm to our reputation, governmental
investigations  and  regulatory  scrutiny,  and  ongoing  litigation.  Additionally,  privacy  and  data  protection  laws  are  evolving,  and  these  laws  may  be
interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data handling safeguards and practices that could result in fines, lawsuits, and other
penalties, and significant changes to our or our third-party partners’ business practices and products and service offerings.

Our future success depends on the reliability and security of our platform. To the extent that the measures we, any companies we acquire, or our
third-party  service  providers,  vendors,  or  business  partners  have  taken  prove  to  be  insufficient  or  inadequate,  or  to  the  extent  we  discover  a  security
breach suffered by a company we acquire following the closing of such acquisition, we may become subject to litigation, breach notification obligations,
or regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties, damages, harm to our reputation, or loss of customers. If our
own  confidential  business  information  or  sensitive  customer  information  were  improperly  disclosed,  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition  could  be  adversely  affected. Additionally,  a  party  who  circumvents  our  security  measures  could,  among  other  effects,  appropriate  customer
information or other proprietary data, cause interruptions in our operations, or expose customers to hacks, viruses, and other disruptions.

Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our customer data, we may
also have obligations to notify customers and regulators about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to
credit  monitoring  services,  pay  significant  fines  to  one  or  more  regulators,  or  pay  compensation  in  connection  with  a  class-action  settlement.  Breach
notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, the SEC has adopted rules for

90

Table of Contents

mandatory  disclosure  of  material  cybersecurity  incidents  suffered  by  public  companies,  as  well  as  cybersecurity  governance  and  risk  management.
Complying  with  these  obligations  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs  and  could  increase  negative  publicity  surrounding  any  incident  that
compromises customer data. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws may also subject us to enforcement action or litigation, any
of which could harm our business. Additionally, the financial exposure from the events referenced above could either not be insured against or not be
fully covered through any insurance that we may maintain, and there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be
enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of the events referenced above. Any of the foregoing could
adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.

Furthermore,  we  may  be  required  to  disclose  personal  data  pursuant  to  demands  from  individuals,  regulators,  government  agencies,  and  law
enforcement  agencies  in  various  jurisdictions  with  conflicting  privacy  and  security  laws,  which  could  result  in  a  breach  of  privacy  and  data  protection
policies,  notices,  laws,  rules,  court  orders,  and  regulations.  Additionally,  changes  in  the  laws  and  regulations  that  govern  our  collection,  use,  and
disclosure of customer data could impose additional requirements with respect to the retention and security of customer data, could limit our marketing
activities, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We  are  subject  to  laws,  regulations,  and  industry  requirements  related  to  data  privacy,  data  protection  and  information  security,  and  user
protection  across  different  markets  where  we  conduct  our  business,  including  in  the  United  States,  European  Economic Area  (the  “EEA”),
and Asia-Pacific region, and such laws, regulations, and industry requirements are constantly evolving and changing. Any actual or perceived
failure to comply with such laws, regulations, and industry requirements, or our privacy policies, could harm our business.

Various local, state, federal, and international laws, directives, and regulations apply to our collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer,
and processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty and continue to evolve in ways that
could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. These laws have a substantial impact on our operations both outside and
in the United States, either directly or as a data processor and handler for various offshore entities.

In the United States, state and federal lawmakers and regulatory authorities have increased their attention on the collection and use of user data and
various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act
(“GLBA”) and state laws relating to privacy and data security. GLBA requires financial institutions to explain their information sharing practices to their
customers and to safeguard sensitive data. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and
state  consumer  protection  laws  as  imposing  standards  for  the  online  collection,  use,  dissemination,  and  security  of  data.  For  example,  California  has
enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”).

The  CCPA  requires  covered  companies  to,  among  other  things,  provide  disclosures  to  individuals  in  California,  and  affords  such  individuals  new
privacy rights such as the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal
information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used, and
shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for security breaches that may increase security breach
litigation.

In addition, other U.S. states have proposed or enacted laws that contain obligations similar to the CCPA that have taken effect or will take effect in
coming years. We cannot fully predict the impact of recently proposed or enacted laws or regulations on our business or operations, but compliance may
require  us  to  modify  our  data  processing  practices  and  policies  incurring  costs  and  expense.  Further,  to  the  extent  multiple  state-level  laws  are
introduced  with  inconsistent  or  conflicting  standards,  it  may  require  costly  and  difficult  efforts  to  achieve  compliance  with  such  laws.  Our  failure  or
perceived failure to comply

91

Table of Contents

with  state  privacy  laws  or  regulations  passed  in  the  future  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  including  how  we  use  personal  information,  operating
results, and financial condition.

Additionally,  many  foreign  countries  and  governmental  bodies,  including Australia,  Brazil,  Kenya,  the  European  Union,  India,  Japan,  Philippines,
Indonesia, Singapore, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and numerous other jurisdictions in which we may operate or conduct our business, have laws and
regulations concerning the collection, use, processing, storage, and deletion of personal data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating
within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require
companies to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access, correct, and delete personal data stored or maintained by such
companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal data, require that certain types of data be retained on local servers within
these jurisdictions, and, in some cases, obtain individuals’ affirmative opt-in consent to collect and use personal data for certain purposes.

We  are  subject  to  both  the  European  Union’s  and  the  United  Kingdom’s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (collectively,  the  “GDPR”),  which
imposes stringent privacy and data protection requirements, and could increase the risk of non-compliance and the costs of providing our products and
services  in  a  compliant  manner. A  breach  of  the  GDPR  could  result  in  regulatory  investigations,  reputational  damage,  fines  and  sanctions,  orders  to
cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). For example, if regulators assert that
we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to €20 million in the European Union (£17.5 million in the U.K.) or 4% of our
worldwide  annual  revenue,  whichever  is  greater.  We  may  also  face  civil  claims  including  representative  actions  and  other  class  action  type  litigation
(where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of
internal resources, and reputational harm.

The  GDPR  and  Swiss  data  protection  laws  impose  strict  rules  on  the  transfer  of  personal  data  out  of  the  E.U.,  U.K.,  or  Switzerland  to  a  “third
country,” including the United States, unless particular compliance mechanisms are implemented. The mechanisms that we and many other companies
rely upon for such data transfers (for example, standard contractual clauses or the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) and the
U.K. extension to the DPF) are the subject of legal challenge, regulatory interpretation, and judicial decisions. In the E.U. and other markets, potential
new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of doing business in those regions.

While  we  maintain  E.U.-U.S.,  Swiss-U.S.  and  U.K.-U.S.  DPF  certification,  we  still  rely  on  the  standard  contractual  clauses  for  intercompany  data
transfers  from  the  European  Union,  Switzerland,  and  the  U.K.  to  the  United  States. As  supervisory  authorities  continue  to  issue  further  guidance  on
personal data, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or regulatory investigations or fines, and if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data
between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or
segregation of our relevant systems and operations and could adversely affect our financial results.

We  are  also  subject  to  evolving  privacy  laws  on  cookies  and  e-marketing  and  online  behavioral  advertising.  As  regulators  become  increasingly
focused on compliance, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert
the attention of our technology personnel, negatively impact our efforts to understand users, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us
to additional liabilities.

There  is  a  risk  that  as  we  expand,  we  may  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Additionally,  there  are
potentially inconsistent world-wide government regulations pertaining to data protection and privacy. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws,
regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings, or platform could
fail, or be alleged to fail to meet applicable requirements. For

92

Table of Contents

instance,  the  overall  regulatory  framework  governing  the  application  of  privacy  laws  to  blockchain  technology  is  still  highly  undeveloped  and  likely  to
evolve. Further there are also changes in the regulatory landscape relating to new and evolving technologies. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party
providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations and to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data, or the
perception  that  any  of  the  foregoing  types  of  failure  has  occurred,  even  if  unfounded,  could  subject  us  to  audits,  inquiries,  whistleblower  complaints,
adverse  media  coverage,  investigations,  severe  criminal,  or  civil  sanctions,  damage  our  reputation,  or  result  in  fines  or  proceedings  by  governmental
agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Issues relating to the development and use of AI in our business could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and
could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We currently leverage internally developed and third-party developed AI into certain aspects of our business and we anticipate that AI will become
increasingly important to our operations in the future. Our competitors and other third parties may incorporate AI into their businesses or offerings more
quickly  or  more  successfully  than  us,  which  could  impair  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and
financial condition.

Our  use  of AI  may  result  in  new  or  expanded  risks  and  liabilities,  including  due  to  enhanced  governmental  or  regulatory  regulation  and  scrutiny,
litigation,  compliance  issues,  ethical  concerns,  confidentiality  or  security  risks,  as  well  as  other  factors  that  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,
business, operating results, and financial condition. Evolving rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us and our third-party
developers to incur significant costs to modify, maintain, or align our business practices, services, and solutions to comply with rules and regulations, the
nature of which cannot be determined at this time and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  use  of AI  and  machine  learning  solutions  and  features  will  enhance  our  products  or  services,  produce  the
intended  results,  or  be  beneficial  to  our  business,  including  our  efficiency. AI  machine  learning  systems  are  complex  and  may  be  flawed,  insufficient,
reflect unwanted forms of bias, or contain errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable, or may cause unintentional or unexpected outputs that
are  incorrect,  do  not  match  our  business  goals,  do  not  comply  with  our  policies  or  those  of  our  regulators,  or  are  otherwise  are  inconsistent  with  our
brand.  If  the  output  that  the  AI  applications  we  use  to  produce  such  output  is,  or  is  alleged  to  be,  inaccurate,  deficient,  or  biased,  our  reputation,
business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Third Parties

Our current and future services are dependent on payment networks and acquiring processors, and any changes to their rules or practices
could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We rely on financial institutions and other payment processors to process customers’ payments in connection with the purchase of crypto assets on
our platform and we pay these providers fees for their services. From time to time, payment networks have increased, and may increase in the future,
the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that use their networks. Payment networks have imposed, and may impose in
the future, special fees on the purchase of crypto assets, including on our platform, which could negatively impact us and significantly increase our costs.
Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us, and may impose additional use
charges which would increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We could attempt to pass these increases along to our customers,
but  this  strategy  might  result  in  the  loss  of  customers  to  our  competitors  that  may  not  pass  along  the  increases,  thereby  reducing  our  revenue  and
earnings. If competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees

93

Table of Contents

to  our  customers  in  the  future,  we  may  have  to  absorb  all  or  a  portion  of  such  increases,  thereby  increasing  our  operating  costs  and  reducing  our
earnings.

We may also be directly or indirectly liable to the payment networks for rule violations. Payment networks set and interpret their network operating
rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved
favorably,  they  may  result  in  significant  fines  and  penalties  or  require  changes  in  our  business  practices  that  may  be  costly  and  adversely  affect  our
business. The payment networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or
even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give customers the option of using cards to fund their purchases
or the choice of currency in which they would like their card to be charged. If we are unable to accept cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our
business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We depend on major mobile operating systems and third-party platforms for the distribution of certain products. If Google Play, the Apple App
Store, or other platforms prevent customers from downloading our apps, our ability to grow may be hindered and our business, operating
results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We rely upon third-party platforms for the distribution of certain products and services. Our Coinbase and the Base App (formerly Coinbase Wallet)
apps are provided as free applications through both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and are also accessible via mobile and traditional
websites. The Google Play Store and Apple App Store are global application distribution platforms and the main distribution channels for our apps. As
such, the promotion, distribution, and operation of our apps are subject to the respective platforms’ terms and policies for application developers, which
are  very  broad  and  subject  to  frequent  changes  and  re-interpretation.  Further,  these  distribution  platforms  often  contain  restrictions  related  to  crypto
assets  that  are  uncertain,  broadly  construed,  and  can  limit  the  nature  and  scope  of  services  that  can  be  offered.  For  example,  Apple  App  Store’s
restrictions related to crypto assets have disrupted the proposed launch of many features within the Coinbase and the Base App apps, including NFT
transfer  services  and  access  to  decentralized  applications.  If  our  products  are  found  to  be  in  violation  of  any  such  terms  and  conditions,  we  may  no
longer be able to offer our products through such third-party platforms. There can be no guarantee that third-party platforms will continue to support our
product offerings, or that customers will be able to continue to use our products. For example, in November 2013, our iOS app was temporarily removed
by  Apple  from  the  Apple  App  Store.  In  December  2019,  we  were  similarly  instructed  by  Apple  to  remove  certain  features  relating  to  decentralized
applications  from  our  application  to  comply  with  the  Apple  App  Store’s  policies.  Any  changes,  bugs,  technical  or  regulatory  issues  with  third-party
platforms,  our  relationships  with  mobile  manufacturers  and  carriers,  or  changes  to  their  terms  of  service  or  policies  could  degrade  our  products’
functionalities, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver high
quality offerings, or impose fees or other charges, any of which could affect our product usage and adversely affect our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Our  intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable,  and  any  inability  to  protect  them  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and
financial condition.

Our business depends in large part on our proprietary technology and our brand. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of
trademark,  trade  dress,  patents,  domain  name,  copyright,  and  trade  secrets,  as  well  as  confidentiality  and  license  agreements  with  our  employees,
contractors,  consultants,  and  third  parties  with  whom  we  have  relationships,  to  establish  and  protect  our  brand  and  other  intellectual  property  rights.
However, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Our proprietary technology and trade secrets could be
lost through misappropriation or breach of our confidentiality and license agreements, and any of our intellectual property rights may be

94

Table of Contents

challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurance that our intellectual
property  rights  will  be  sufficient  to  protect  against  others  offering  products,  services,  or  technologies  that  are  substantially  similar  to  ours  and  that
compete with our business.

We do not intend to monetize our patents or attempt to block third parties from competing with us by asserting our patents offensively, but our ability
to successfully defend intellectual property challenges from competitors and other parties may depend, in part and where permissible, on our ability to
counter-assert  our  patents  defensively.  Effective  protection  of  our  intellectual  property  may  be  expensive  and  difficult  to  maintain,  both  in  terms  of
application and registration costs as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. As we have grown, we have sought to obtain and protect
our  intellectual  property  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  countries,  a  process  that  can  be  expensive  and  may  not  always  be  successful.  In  some
instances,  patent  applications  or  patents  may  be  abandoned  or  allowed  to  lapse,  resulting  in  partial  or  complete  loss  of  patent  rights  in  a  relevant
jurisdiction. Further, intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products and services are available, and the
regulatory landscape in such jurisdictions may evolve rapidly, leading to an unanticipated change in the ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property
rights in these jurisdictions. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third
parties.  In  addition,  many  countries  limit  the  enforceability  of  patents  against  certain  third  parties,  including  government  agencies  or  government
contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. We may also agree to license our patents to third parties as part of various
patent pools and open patent projects. Those licenses may diminish our ability, though, to counter-assert our patents against certain parties that may
bring claims against us.

We have been, and in the future may be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.

In recent years, there has been considerable patent, copyright, trademark, domain name, trade secret, and other intellectual property development
activity  in  the  cryptoeconomy,  as  well  as  litigation,  based  on  allegations  of  infringement  or  other  violations  of  intellectual  property,  including  by  large
financial institutions. Furthermore, individuals and groups can purchase patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of
infringement  to  extract  settlements  from  companies  like  ours.  Our  use  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights  also  may  be  subject  to  claims  of
infringement or misappropriation. We cannot guarantee that our internally developed or acquired technologies and content do not or will not infringe the
intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating
their  intellectual  property  rights,  and  we  may  be  found  to  be  infringing  upon  such  rights. Any  claims  or  litigation  could  cause  us  to  incur  significant
expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering
our  products  or  services  or  using  certain  technologies,  force  us  to  implement  expensive  or  less  effective  work-arounds,  or  impose  other  unfavorable
terms. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the crypto assets market grows and matures. Accordingly, our exposure
to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources. Further, during
the course of any litigation, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments. If securities
analysts  and  investors  regard  these  announcements  as  negative,  the  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  may  decline.  Even  if  intellectual
property claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert
the  resources  of  our  management  and  require  significant  expenditures. Any  of  the  foregoing  could  prevent  us  from  competing  effectively  and  could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source
software licenses could harm our business.

Our  platform  contains  software  modules  licensed  to  us  by  third-party  authors  under  “open  source”  licenses.  We  also  make  certain  of  our  own
software available to users for free under various open source licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of
third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections
regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise
our platform.

Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon
the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source
software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the
public. This  would  allow  our  competitors  to  create  similar  offerings  with  lower  development  effort  and  time  and  ultimately  could  result  in  a  loss  of  our
competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial
time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.

We have not recently conducted an extensive audit of our use of open source software and, as a result, we cannot assure you that our processes for
controlling our use of open source software in our platform are, or will be, effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the
terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face litigation, infringement claims, or other liabilities. Likewise, we may be required
to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to
discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source
code  form,  our  proprietary  code,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Moreover,  the  terms  of
many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. As a result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a
way  that  could  impose  unanticipated  conditions  or  restrictions  on  our  ability  to  provide  or  distribute  our  platform.  From  time  to  time,  there  have  been
claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we
could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software.

Risks Related to Our Employees and Other Service Providers

The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We operate in a relatively new industry that is not widely understood and requires highly skilled and technical personnel. We believe that our future
success  is  highly  dependent  on  the  talents  and  contributions  of  our  senior  management  team,  including  Mr.  Armstrong,  our  co-founder  and  Chief
Executive Officer, members of our executive team, and other key employees across product, engineering, risk management, finance, compliance and
legal, and marketing. Our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The pool
of qualified talent in our industry is extremely limited, particularly with respect to executive talent, engineering, risk management, and financial regulatory
expertise.  We  face  intense  competition  for  qualified  individuals  from  numerous  software  and  other  technology  companies.  To  attract  and  retain  key
personnel, we incur significant costs, including salaries and benefits and equity incentives. Even so, these measures may not be enough to attract and
retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. The loss of even a few key employees or senior leaders, or an inability to attract,
retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could adversely affect our business, operating
results, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow.

Our culture emphasizes innovation, and if we cannot maintain this culture, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

We believe that our entrepreneurial and innovative corporate culture has been a key contributor to our success. We encourage and empower our
employees to develop and launch new and innovative products and services, which we believe is essential to attracting high quality talent, partners, and
developers, as well as serving the best, long-term interests of our company. If we cannot maintain this culture, we could lose the innovation, creativity
and teamwork that has been integral to our business. Additionally, from time to time, we realign our resources and talent to implement stage-appropriate
business strategies, including furloughs, layoffs, or reductions in force. In such cases, we may find it difficult to prevent a negative effect on employee
morale or attrition beyond our planned reduction, in which case our products and services may suffer and our business, operating results, and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

In the event of employee or service provider misconduct or error, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

We have and may in the future experience employee or service provider misconduct. Employee or service provider misconduct or error could subject
us  to  legal  liability,  financial  losses,  and  regulatory  sanctions  and  could  seriously  harm  our  reputation  and  negatively  affect  our  business.  Such
misconduct  could  include  engaging  in  improper  or  unauthorized  transactions  or  activities,  misappropriation  of  customer  funds,  insider  trading  and
misappropriation of information, failing to supervise other employees or service providers, improperly using confidential information, as well as improper
trading  activity  such  as  spoofing,  layering,  wash  trading,  manipulation  and  front-running.  Employee  or  service  provider  errors,  including  mistakes  in
executing, recording, or processing transactions for customers, could expose us to the risk of material losses even if the errors are detected. Although
we have implemented processes and procedures and provide trainings to our employees and service providers to reduce the likelihood of misconduct
and error, these efforts may not be successful. Moreover, the risk of employee or service provider error or misconduct may be even greater for novel
products and services and is compounded by the fact that many of our employees and service providers are accustomed to working at tech companies
which  generally  do  not  maintain  the  same  compliance  customs  and  rules  as  financial  services  firms.  This  can  lead  to  high  risk  of  confusion  among
employees and service providers with respect to compliance obligations, particularly including confidentiality, data access, trading, and conflicts. It is not
always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. If we were found to
have not met our regulatory oversight and compliance and other obligations, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions, financial penalties, restrictions
on  our  activities  for  failure  to  properly  identify,  monitor  and  respond  to  potentially  problematic  activity  and  seriously  damage  our  reputation.  Our
employees, contractors, and agents could also commit errors that subject us to financial claims for negligence, as well as regulatory actions, or result in
financial liability. Further, allegations by regulatory or criminal authorities of improper trading activities could affect our brand and reputation.

Our officers, directors, employees, and large stockholders may encounter potential conflicts of interests with respect to their positions or
interests in certain crypto assets, entities, and other initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.

We  frequently  engage  in  a  wide  variety  of  transactions  and  maintain  relationships  with  a  significant  number  of  crypto  projects,  their  developers,
members of their ecosystem, and investors. These transactions and relationships could create potential conflicts of interests in management decisions
that  we  make.  For  instance,  certain  of  our  officers,  directors,  and  employees  are  active  investors  in  crypto  projects  themselves,  and  may  make
investment  decisions  that  favor  projects  that  they  have  personally  invested  in.  Many  of  our  large  stockholders  also  make  investments  in  these  crypto
projects. In addition, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Armstrong, is involved in a number of initiatives related to the cryptoeconomy and
more  broadly.  For  example,  Mr.  Armstrong  currently  serves  as  the  chief  executive  officer  of  ResearchHub  Technologies,  Inc.,  a  scientific  research
development platform. This and other

97

Table of Contents

initiatives he is involved in could divert Mr. Armstrong's time and attention from overseeing our business operations which could have a negative impact
on our business. Moreover, we may in the future be subject to litigation as a result of his involvement with these other initiatives.

Similarly, certain of our directors, officers, employees, and large stockholders may hold crypto assets that we are considering supporting for trading
on our platform, and may be more supportive of such listing notwithstanding legal, regulatory, and other issues associated with such crypto assets. While
we have instituted policies and procedures to limit and mitigate such risks, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective, or
that we will be able to manage such conflicts of interests adequately. If we fail to manage these conflicts of interests, or we receive unfavorable media
coverage with respect to actual or perceived conflicts of interest, our business could be harmed and the brand, reputation and credibility of our company
could be adversely affected.

General Risk Factors

Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our business.

Our performance is subject to general economic conditions, and their impact on the crypto asset markets and our customers. The United States and
other  key  international  economies  have  experienced  cyclical  downturns  from  time  to  time  in  which  economic  activity  declined  resulting  in  lower
consumption  rates,  restricted  credit,  reduced  profitability,  weaknesses  in  financial  markets,  bankruptcies,  and  overall  uncertainty  with  respect  to  the
economy. Adverse general economic conditions have impacted in the past, and may impact in the future, the cryptoeconomy, although the extent of such
impacts remains uncertain and dependent on a variety of factors, including market adoption of crypto assets, global trends in the cryptoeconomy, central
bank monetary policies, instability in the global banking system, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and other events beyond our
control.  Geopolitical  developments,  such  as  trade  wars  and  foreign  exchange  limitations  can  also  increase  the  severity  and  levels  of  unpredictability
globally and increase the volatility of global financial and crypto asset markets. For example, in the past the capital and credit markets have experienced
extreme volatility and disruptions, resulting in steep declines in the value of crypto assets. To the extent general economic conditions and crypto assets
markets materially deteriorate or decline for a prolonged period, our ability to generate revenue and to attract and retain customers could suffer and our
business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, even if general economic conditions were to improve following
any such deterioration, there is no guarantee that the cryptoeconomy would similarly improve.

Further, in 2022, a number of blockchain protocols and crypto financial firms, and in particular protocols and firms involving high levels of financial
leverage such as high-yield lending products or derivatives trading, suffered from insolvency and liquidity crises leading to the 2022 Events. Some of the
2022 Events are alleged or have been held to be the result of fraudulent activity by insiders, including misappropriation of customer funds and other illicit
activity  and  internal  controls  failures.  In  connection  with  the  2022  Events,  concerns  were  raised  about  the  potential  for  a  market  condition  where  the
failure of one company leads to the financial distress of other companies, which has the potential to depress the prices of assets used as collateral by
other firms. If such a market condition were to become widespread in the cryptoeconomy, we could suffer from increased counterparty risk, including
defaults  or  bankruptcies  of  major  customers  or  counterparties,  which  could  lead  to  significantly  reduced  activity  on  our  platform  and  fewer  available
crypto market opportunities in general. Further, forced selling of crypto assets by distressed companies could lead to lower crypto asset prices and may
lead to a reduction in our revenue. To the extent that conditions in the general economic and crypto asset markets were to materially deteriorate, our
ability to attract and retain customers may suffer.

Actual  events  involving  limited  liquidity,  defaults,  non-performance  or  other  adverse  developments  that  affect  financial  institutions,  transactional
counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry, or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any such
events or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example,

98

Table of Contents

in March 2023, Silvergate Capital Corp. announced it would wind down operations and liquidate Silvergate Bank. Soon after, the FDIC was appointed
receiver of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In connection with these issues and issues with other financial institutions, the prices of fiat-backed
stablecoins, including USDC, were temporarily impacted and may be similarly impacted again in the future. Further, if the instability in the global banking
system continues or worsens, there could be additional negative ramifications, such as additional all market-wide liquidity problems or impacted access
to  deposits  and  investments  for  customers  of  affected  financial  institutions  and  certain  partners,  and  our  business,  operating  results  and  financial
condition could be adversely affected.

We are a remote-first company which subjects us to heightened operational risks.

Our  employees  and  service  providers  work  from  home  and  we  are  a  remote-first  company. This  subjects  us  to  heightened  operational  risks.  For
example, technologies in our employees’ and service providers’ homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information
systems, applications, and other tools available to employees and service providers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. Further, the
security  systems  in  place  at  our  employees’  and  service  providers’  homes  may  be  less  secure  than  those  used  in  our  offices,  and  while  we  have
implemented technical and administrative safeguards to help protect our systems as our employees and service providers work from home, we may be
subject to increased cybersecurity risk, which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, and could disrupt our business operations. There is no
guarantee that the data security and privacy safeguards we have put in place will be completely effective or that we will not encounter risks associated
with  employees  and  service  providers  accessing  company  data  and  systems  remotely.  We  also  face  challenges  due  to  the  need  to  operate  with  the
remote workforce and are addressing those challenges to minimize the impact on our ability to operate.

Environmental, social, and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.

There is focus from certain investors, regulators, employees, users and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to
environmental,  social,  and  governance  matters  (“ESG”)  and  related  assurances  and  disclosures.  Compliance  with  recently  adopted  and  potential
upcoming ESG requirements, including the E.U.’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and
California’s climate-related bills, may require the dedication of significant time and resources. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations
or changes to existing legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or if we fail to meet investor, industry, or stakeholder expectations and
standards relating to ESG matters, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, we may be
subject  to  fines,  penalties,  regulatory  or  other  enforcement  actions,  and  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely
affected.

Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, as well as the application of such laws, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

We are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in the United States and a variety of foreign jurisdictions. All of these jurisdictions have in the
past  and  may  in  the  future  make  changes  to  their  corporate  income  tax  rates  and  other  income  tax  laws  which  could  increase  our  future  income  tax
provision. For example, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by earnings that are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where
we have lower statutory rates and by earnings that are higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the
valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  by  changes  in  the  amount  of  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  or  by  changes  in  tax  laws,  regulations,
accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, including changes with possible retroactive application or effect.

Our determination of our tax liability is subject to review and may be challenged by applicable U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome

of such a challenge could harm our operating results

99

Table of Contents

and financial condition. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and, in the
ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is complex and uncertain. Moreover, as a
multinational  business,  we  have  subsidiaries  that  engage  in  many  intercompany  transactions  in  a  variety  of  tax  jurisdictions  where  the  ultimate  tax
determination  is  complex  and  uncertain.  Our  existing  corporate  structure  and  intercompany  arrangements  have  been  implemented  in  a  manner  we
believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. Furthermore, as we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be
subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different
countries to have conflicting views with respect to, among other things, the characterization and source of income or other tax items, the manner in which
the arm’s-length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. The taxing authorities of the
jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  may  challenge  our  tax  treatment  of  certain  items  or  the  methodologies  we  use  for  valuing  developed  technology  or
intercompany arrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results.

Further, any changes in the tax laws governing our activities may increase our tax expense, the amount of taxes we pay, or both. For example, the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), enacted in 2017, significantly reformed the U.S. federal tax code, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax
rate,  making  sweeping  changes  to  the  rules  governing  international  business  operations,  and  imposing  new  limitations  on  a  number  of  tax  benefits,
including deductions for business interest and the use of net operating loss carryforwards. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction
Act”),  enacted  in  2022,  further  amended  the  U.S.  federal  tax  code,  imposing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  “adjusted  financial  statement  income”  of  certain
corporations as well as an excise tax on the repurchase or redemption of stock by certain corporations, beginning in the 2023 tax year. In addition, over
the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”)
Project  that,  if  implemented,  would  change  various  aspects  of  the  existing  framework  under  which  our  tax  obligations  are  determined  in  many  of  the
countries  in  which  we  do  business. As  of  December  2024,  over  140  countries  have  approved  a  framework  that  imposes  a  minimum  tax  rate  of  15%,
among other provisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact
of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Many of these provisions have been modified by the recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill,”
signed into law on July 4, 2025. Moreover, the G7 countries, including the United States, recently agreed to modify the provisions of the BEPS Project
which may limit its impact on us in future years. There can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income
tax, impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits, or make other changes that could impact our cash flows and adversely affect our
business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition, the IRS has yet to issue guidance on a number of important issues regarding the tax treatment of cryptocurrency and the products we
provide  to  our  customers  and  from  which  we  derive  our  income.  In  the  absence  of  such  guidance,  we  will  take  positions  with  respect  to  any  such
unsettled issues. There is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be
imposed that could adversely affect our business, cash flows or financial performance.

We  also  are  subject  to  non-income  taxes,  such  as  payroll,  sales,  use,  value-added,  digital  services,  net  worth,  property,  and  goods  and  services
taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Specifically, we may be subject to new allocations of tax as a result of increasing efforts by
certain  jurisdictions  to  tax  activities  that  may  not  have  been  subject  to  tax  under  existing  tax  principles.  Companies  such  as  ours  may  be  adversely
impacted by such taxes. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. As a result, we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities
that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements

and any such difference may harm our operating results in

100

Table of Contents

future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.

Our ability to use our deferred tax assets may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. or foreign law.

Realization of our deferred tax assets, in the form of future domestic or foreign tax deductions, credits or other tax benefits, will depend on future
taxable income, and there is a risk that some or all of such tax assets could be subject to limitation or otherwise unavailable to offset future income tax
liabilities,  all  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  For  example,  future  changes  in  our  stock  ownership,  the  causes  of  which  may  be
outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which could limit our
use of such tax assets in certain circumstances. Similarly, additional changes may be made to U.S. (federal and state) and foreign tax laws which could
further limit our ability to fully utilize these tax assets against future taxable income.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, our ability to utilize tax deductions or losses from prior years may be limited by the imposition of the 15% minimum
tax if such minimum tax applies to us. Therefore, we may be required to pay additional U.S. federal income taxes despite any available tax deductions,
U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, credits, or other tax benefits that we accumulate.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through our international operations could have a negative impact on our operating
results and financial condition. From time to time, we may engage in currency hedging activities to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations  that  arise  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  use  of  hedging  instruments  may  not  offset  any  or  more  than  a  portion  of  the  adverse
financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, and may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges
with such instruments.

If our estimates or judgment relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely
affected.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requires  management  to  make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the
section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part I, Item 2
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities,
and equity, and the amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments that comprise our critical
accounting  estimates  involve  the  valuation  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  business  combinations,  valuation  of  strategic  investments,
evaluation of tax positions, and evaluation of legal and other contingencies. Our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely
affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to differ from
the expectations of analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.

We may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism,
that could disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a
serious disaster.

Natural  disasters  or  other  catastrophic  events  may  also  cause  damage  or  disruption  to  our  operations,  international  commerce,  and  the  global
economy,  and  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  condition.  Our  business  operations  are  subject  to
interruption by

101

Table of Contents

natural disasters, fire, power shortages, and other events beyond our control. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public
health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, the COVID-19
pandemic and the related precautionary measures that we adopted have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in difficulties or changes to
our  customer  support,  or  create  operational  or  other  challenges,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial
condition. Further, acts of terrorism, labor activism or unrest, and other geopolitical unrest, including ongoing regional conflicts around the world, could
cause  disruptions  in  our  business  or  the  businesses  of  our  partners  or  the  economy  as  a  whole.  In  the  event  of  a  natural  disaster,  including  a  major
earthquake, blizzard, or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our
operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in development of our platform, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of
data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. We do not maintain insurance sufficient to
compensate us for the potentially significant losses that could result from disruptions to our services. Additionally, all the aforementioned risks may be
further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our partners’ disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. To the extent natural
disasters or other catastrophic events concurrently impact data centers we rely on in connection with private key restoration, customers will experience
significant delays in withdrawing funds, or in the extreme we may suffer loss of customer funds.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting, our ability to
produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.

As  a  public  company  we  incur  significant  legal,  accounting,  and  other  expenses.  The  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of  2002  and  related  rules  of  the  SEC
require,  among  other  things,  that  we  maintain  effective  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  order  to
maintain  and,  if  required,  improve  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  meet  this  standard,  we  have
expended,  and  anticipate  that  we  will  continue  to  expend,  significant  resources,  including  accounting-related  costs  and  significant  management
oversight. If we encounter material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis
and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be materially misstated.

Any  failure  to  implement  and  maintain  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  also  adversely  affect  the  results  of  periodic
management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control
over  financial  reporting  that  are  required  to  be  included  in  our  periodic  reports  filed  with  the  SEC.  Ineffective  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  adversely  affect  investor  confidence  in  us  and,  as  a  result,  negatively  impact  the  price  of  our  Class  A
common stock and have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.

We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, debt, and cash flows generated from operations. We cannot be
certain that our operations will continue to fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments in our
business,  which  investments  may  require  us  to  secure  additional  funds. Additional  financing  may  not  be  available  on  terms  favorable  to  us,  if  at  all,
including due to general macroeconomic conditions, crypto market conditions and any disruptions in the crypto market, instability in the global banking
system, increasing regulatory uncertainty and scrutiny or other unforeseen factors. In the event of a downgrade of our credit rating, our ability to raise
additional financing may be adversely affected and any future debt offerings or credit arrangements we propose to enter into may be on less favorable
terms or terms that may not be acceptable to us. In addition, even if debt financing is available, the cost of additional

102

Table of Contents

financing  may  be  significantly  higher  than  our  current  debt.  If  we  incur  additional  debt,  the  debt  holders  would  have  rights  senior  to  holders  of  our
common  stock  to  make  claims  on  our  assets,  and  the  terms  of  any  debt  could  restrict  our  operations,  including  our  ability  to  pay  dividends  on  our
common stock. Furthermore, we have authorized the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock and common stock that our board of directors could use
to, among other things, issue shares of our capital stock in the form of blockchain tokens, implement a stockholder rights plan, or issue other shares of
preferred stock or common stock. We may issue shares of capital stock, including in the form of blockchain tokens, to our customers in connection with
customer reward or loyalty programs. If we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could
have rights senior to those of our currently authorized and issued common stock. The trading prices for our common stock may be highly volatile, which
may  reduce  our  ability  to  access  capital  on  favorable  terms  or  at  all.  In  addition,  a  slowdown  or  other  sustained  adverse  downturn  in  the  general
economic or crypto asset markets could adversely affect our business and the value of our Class A common stock. Because our decision to raise capital
in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of
any future issuances of securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our
Class A common stock and diluting their interests.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and could decline significantly and rapidly. Market volatility may affect the
value of an investment in our Class A common stock and could subject us to litigation.

Prior to the listing of our Class A common stock on Nasdaq, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. Technology stocks
have  historically  experienced  high  levels  of  volatility.  The  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  also  could  be  subject  to  wide  fluctuations  in
response to the risk factors described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and others beyond our control, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the number of shares of our Class A common stock publicly owned and available for trading;

overall performance of the equity markets or publicly-listed financial services and technology companies;

our actual or anticipated operating performance and the operating performance of our competitors;

changes in the projected operational and financial results we provide to the public or our failure to meet those projections;

failure  of  securities  analysts  to  initiate  or  maintain  coverage  of  us,  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  any  securities  analysts  who  follow  our
company, or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;

any major change in our board of directors, management, or key personnel;

if we issue additional shares of capital stock, including in the form of blockchain tokens, in connection with customer reward or loyalty programs;

issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding
2026 Convertible Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes;

repurchases by us of any of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock, including under the Share Repurchase Program, on unfavorable
terms or at all;

the highly volatile nature of the cryptoeconomy and the prices of crypto assets;

103

Table of Contents

•

•

•

rumors and market speculation involving the cryptoeconomy and the regulation thereof, or us or other companies in our industry;

announcements  by  us  or  our  competitors  of  significant  innovations,  new  products,  services,  features,  integrations  or  capabilities,  acquisitions,
strategic investments, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; and

other  events  or  factors,  including  those  resulting  from  political  instability  and  acts  of  war  or  terrorism,  regional  conflicts  around  the  world,
government shutdowns, bank failures, or responses to these events.

Furthermore, the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market
prices  of  equity  securities  of  many  companies  and  financial  services  and  technology  companies  in  particular.  These  fluctuations  often  have  been
unrelated  or  disproportionate  to  the  operating  performance  of  those  companies.  These  broad  market  and  industry  fluctuations,  as  well  as  general
macroeconomic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact
the  market  price  of  our  Class A  common  stock.  In  the  past,  companies  that  have  experienced  volatility  in  the  market  price  of  their  stock  have  been
subject to securities class action litigation. We are currently subject to stockholder litigation, as described in the section titled “Legal Proceedings” in Part
II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and may continue to be the target of these types of actions or additional regulatory uncertainty and
scrutiny  in  the  future.  Securities  or  regulatory  actions  against  us  could  result  in  substantial  costs  and  divert  our  management’s  attention  from  other
business concerns, which could harm our business.

The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders, including our directors,
executive officers, and 5% stockholders, and their respective affiliates. As a result of this structure, our Chief Executive Officer and trusts
established by our Chief Executive Officer collectively have control over key decision making as a result of controlling a majority of our
voting stock. This ownership will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments
of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate
transaction requiring stockholder approval.

Our Class B common stock has twenty votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Mr. Armstrong and the independent
trustee of trusts established by Mr. Armstrong, collectively, are currently able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our
outstanding capital stock and, along with our directors, other executive officers, and 5% stockholders, and their affiliates, these stockholders hold in the
aggregate a substantial majority of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock
and our Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock, including Mr. Armstrong, collectively are expected to continue to control a
significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for
approval until the earliest to occur of (i) the date fixed by the board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days after the date that
the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock held by Brian Armstrong and his affiliates is less than 25% of the aggregate number of shares
of Class B common stock held by Mr. Armstrong and his affiliates on April 1, 2021, the date of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1 for
the  listing  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  on  Nasdaq;  (ii)  the  date  and  time  specified  by  affirmative  vote  of  the  holders  of  at  least  66-2/3%  of  the
outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class, and the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the then serving members of our
board of directors, which must include the affirmative vote of Mr. Armstrong, if either (A) Mr. Armstrong is serving on our board of directors and has not
been terminated for cause or resigned except for good reason (as each term is defined in our restated certificate of incorporation) from his position as
our Chief Executive Officer or (B) Mr. Armstrong has not been removed for cause or resigned from the position of Chairman of the board of directors; and
(iii) the death or disability (as defined in our

restated  certificate  of  incorporation)  of  Mr. Armstrong,  when  all  outstanding  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  will  convert  automatically  into  shares  of
Class  A  common  stock.  Holders  of  our  Class  A  common  stock  are  not  entitled  to  vote  separately  as  a  single  class  except  under  certain  limited
circumstances. This concentrated control may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election
of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major
corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital
stock  that  you  may  believe  are  in  your  best  interest  as  one  of  our  stockholders.  In  addition,  Mr.  Armstrong  has  significant  influence  over  (i)  the
management  and  major  strategic  investments  of  our  company  as  a  result  of  his  position  as  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  (ii)  the  election  or
replacement of our directors as a result of his voting rights. As a board member and officer, Mr. Armstrong owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and
must  act  in  good  faith  in  a  manner  he  reasonably  believes  to  be  in  the  best  interests  of  our  stockholders.  As  a  stockholder,  even  a  controlling
stockholder, Mr. Armstrong is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in
the interests of our stockholders generally.

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited
exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have
the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock, including Mr. Armstrong, who retain their shares
in  the  long  term.  Moreover,  it  is  possible  that  one  or  more  of  the  persons  or  entities  holding  our  Class  B  common  stock  could  gain  significant  voting
control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock.

The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.

Certain  stock  index  providers  exclude  companies  with  multiple  classes  of  shares  of  common  stock  from  being  added  to  certain  stock  indices.  In
addition,  several  stockholder  advisory  firms  and  large  institutional  investors  oppose  the  use  of  multiple  class  structures.  As  a  result,  the  dual  class
structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices, may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish
negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result in large
institutional investors not purchasing shares of our Class A common stock. Any exclusion from stock indices could result in less demand for our Class A
common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital
structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.

Sales or distribution of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales or distributions might occur,
could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

The sale or distribution of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock, particularly sales by us or our directors, executive officers,
and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur in large quantities, could cause the market price of our Class A
common stock to decline.

In  addition,  we  have  filed  a  registration  statement  to  register  shares  reserved  for  future  issuance  under  our  equity  compensation  plans. All  of  the
shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or vesting and settlement of restricted stock
units and performance restricted stock units will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable vesting requirements
and compliance by affiliates with Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

Further, certain holders of shares of our common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the
public resale of shares of Class A common stock or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. Any
registration  statement  we  file  to  register  additional  shares,  whether  as  a  result  of  registration  rights  or  otherwise,  could  cause  the  market  price  of  our
Class A common stock to decline or be volatile.

We also may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock, including in the form of blockchain tokens, from time to time in
connection with a financing, an acquisition, investments, pursuant to customer rewards, loyalty programs, and other incentive plans, or otherwise. Any
such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our
business, the price of our Class A common stock and its liquidity could decline.

The trading market for our Class A common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us
or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities and industry analysts cease coverage of
us altogether, the market price for our Class A common stock may be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our
Class A common stock, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A common stock may decline. If one or
more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which
might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline. In light of the unpredictability inherent in our business, our financial outlook
commentary may differ from analysts’ expectations, which could cause volatility to the price of our Class A common stock.

We cannot guarantee that the Share Repurchase Program will be fully consummated or that such program will enhance the long-term value of
our Class A common stock price.

In October 2024, our board of directors authorized and approved the Share Repurchase Program, which provides for the repurchase of up to $1.0
billion of our outstanding Class A common stock without expiration. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market (including through
trading  plans  intended  to  qualify  under  Rule  10b5-1  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”)),  in  privately
negotiated transactions, or by other methods in accordance with the applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The timing of any repurchases will
depend on market conditions and will be made at our discretion. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount
or number of shares of our Class A common stock, and the program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.

The Share Repurchase Program could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase the volatility thereof. Price volatility may cause the
average price at which we repurchase our Class A common stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. There can be no
assurance that the Share Repurchase Program will have a positive impact on our Class A common stock price or net income (loss) per share. Important
factors  that  could  cause  us  to  discontinue  or  decrease  share  repurchases  under  the  Share  Repurchase  Program  include,  among  others:  unfavorable
market conditions; the market price of our Class A common stock; the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to
time; our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase
Program; and the availability of funds necessary to fulfill such repurchases.

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, and certain rules imposed by regulatory authorities, could make an acquisition
of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current
management, limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees,
and limit the price of our Class A common stock.

Provisions  in  our  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  and  restated  bylaws  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a  merger,  acquisition,  or
other  change  of  control  of  our  company  that  the  stockholders  may  consider  favorable.  In  addition,  because  our  board  of  directors  is  responsible  for
appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Our restated certificate of incorporation
and restated bylaws include provisions that:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;

require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;

authorize  the  issuance  of  “blank  check”  preferred  stock  and  common  stock  that  our  board  of  directors  could  use  to  implement  a  stockholder
rights plan or issue other shares of preferred stock or common stock, including blockchain tokens;

provide that only our Chief Executive Officer, the chairperson of our board of directors, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to
call a special meeting of stockholders;

eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;

prohibit cumulative voting;

provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of matters
requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and
Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company
or its assets;

provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our restated bylaws; and

provide for advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by
stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.

Moreover,  Section  203  of  the  Delaware  General  Corporation  Law  (the  “DGCL”)  may  discourage,  delay,  or  prevent  a  change  of  control  of  our
company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between holders of 15% or more of our
common stock and us.

In addition, a third party attempting to acquire us or a substantial position in our common stock may be delayed or ultimately prevented from doing so
by change in ownership or control regulations to which our regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject. FINRA Rule 1017 generally provides that
FINRA approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a single person or entity owning, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of a
member firm’s equity and would include a change of control of a parent company.

Our restated certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision for certain claims, which could limit our stockholders’ ability
to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our restated certificate of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the
exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim that is based upon a breach of fiduciary duty;
any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of ours, arising pursuant to the DGCL,
our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or
any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL.

Moreover, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or
liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district
courts of the United States of America are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. Our decision
to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid
under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine
that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our
stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. Section
27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the
rules and regulations thereunder. The Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by  law. Accordingly,  actions  by  our  stockholders  to  enforce  any  duty  or  liability  created  by  the  Exchange Act  or  the  rules  and
regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities
laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Any  person  or  entity  purchasing  or  otherwise  acquiring  or  holding  any  interest  in  any  of  our  securities  will  be  deemed  to  have  notice  of  and
consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim
in a judicial forum they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and
our  directors,  officers,  and  other  employees. Alternatively,  if  a  court  were  to  find  the  choice  of  forum  provision  contained  in  our  restated  certificate  of
incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions,
which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In  October  2024,  the  Board  authorized  the  repurchase  of  up  to  an  aggregate  of  $1.0  billion  of  the  Company’s  Class  A  common  stock  without
expiration. The  Share  Repurchase  Program  does  not  obligate  the  Company  to  repurchase  any  dollar  amount  or  number  of  shares  of  the  Company’s
Class  A  common  stock,  and  the  program  may  be  modified,  suspended,  or  discontinued  at  any  time.  As  of  June  30,  2025,  no  shares  have  been
repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program.
