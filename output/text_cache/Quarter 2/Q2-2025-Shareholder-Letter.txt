Second Quarter 2025

July 31, 2025

We delivered solid financial results in Q2, generating $1.5 billion in total revenue, $1.4 billion in net income 

(which includes both a $1.5 billion gain on strategic investments and a $362 million gain on crypto investment 

assets), $33 million in Adjusted Net Income (which excludes both aforementioned items) and $512 million in 

Adjusted EBITDA. Transaction revenue was $764 million. Subscription and services revenue was $656 million, 

driven by continued growth in average USDC balances, native units staked, and all-time high average Prime 

Financing balances. We also had all-time high average market share of crypto assets on our custody platform. 

We ended Q2 with $9.3 billion in total $USD resources, reinforcing our ability to invest in innovation and long-

term growth, as well as $1.8 billion in our crypto asset investment portfolio, fueled by weekly BTC purchases.

We are working to bring the financial system onchain and made progress in Q2 across each phase of crypto 

adoption: first—as an investment, second—as financial services, and third—as an app platform. For 

investments, we continued to innovate and scale our derivatives business, launching the broadest suite of 

CFTC-regulated crypto perpetual futures products in the U.S. and achieving all-time highs in derivatives trading 

volume and open interest on our international derivatives exchange. For financial services, we helped grow 

USDC adoption, with average balances in Coinbase products increasing 13% Q/Q to $13.8 billion, driven in 

part by an extension of our rewards program, and announced new initiatives like USDC on Base Chain going 

live in Shopify Payments, Coinbase Business, and Coinbase One Card—all of which increase the daily utility of 

crypto. As an app platform, we continued to scale the Base Chain, reaching new milestones of transactions 

processing in milliseconds for millicents, reinforcing its position as the fastest and cheapest Layer 2 network. 

Additionally, we launched the Base App (formerly Coinbase Wallet) in open beta and have over 700,000 people 

on the waitlist, creating a unified experience for trading, payments, social, and more.

On the policy front, July marked monumental milestones for us. The GENIUS Act, the first U.S. federal 

legislation for digital assets, was signed into law, and the House passed the CLARITY Act, which sets a market 

structure framework for digital assets. These bills provide a clear regulatory foundation for stablecoins and 

digital assets, potentially unlocking new opportunities for Coinbase and reinforcing U.S. leadership in digital 

finance. 

Fellow 
Shareholders,

[1] Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial 

measure.

[2] Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial 

measure that excludes $1.5 billion in pre-tax gains on 

strategic investments—which included an unrealized 

gain on our investment in Circle—and a $362 million 

pre-tax gain on our crypto investment portfolio (largely 

unrealized).

1 Announced on the Current Report 
on Form 8-K we filed with the SEC 
on May 15, 2025.

Chapter 1: Q2 was a solid quarter amid lower volatility. Total revenue in Q2 was $1.5 billion, down 26% Q/
Q. Transaction revenue was $764 million, down 39% Q/Q. Subscription and services revenue was $656 million, 
down 6% Q/Q. Total operating expenses grew $193 million or 15% Q/Q to $1.5 billion, driven by $307 million in 
expenses related to the data theft incident disclosed in May1. Technology & development, general & 
administrative, and sales & marketing expenses collectively decreased 2% to $977 million. Net income was 
$1.4 billion, Adjusted Net Income was $33 million (excluding $1.5 billion in pre-tax gains on strategic 
investments—which included an unrealized gain on our investment in Circle—and a $362 million pre-tax gain 
on our crypto investment portfolio (largely unrealized)), and Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. We ended Q2 
with $9.3 billion in $USD resources, $1.8 billion in crypto assets held for investment, and 4,279 full-time 
employees.

Chapter 2: Building the financial system onchain through every phase of adoption. In Q2, Coinbase 
made significant strides in bringing the financial system onchain by expanding access to trading through 
innovative derivative products, listing more spot assets, and expanding our offerings in markets globally. We 
deepened financial utility with payment focused innovations like Coinbase Business, USDC integration with 
Shopify, and the announcement of the Coinbase One Card. Infrastructure upgrades included Base Chain’s 
decentralization milestones, faster transaction speeds, and expanded stablecoin distribution, reinforcing our 
platform flywheel. These efforts empower users and institutions alike, positioning Coinbase as a leader in 
driving a faster, more open, and globally connected financial system.

Chapter 3: Significant progress in policy and regulatory clarity. We reached significant milestones in 
advancing crypto policy and regulation both domestically and internationally. The GENIUS Act was signed into 
law in July, the first-ever U.S. federal legislation for digital assets, establishing clear rules for USD stablecoin 
issuers, while the CLARITY Act similarly passed the House with strong bipartisan support, reinforcing crypto as 
a unifying issue in Washington. The GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act together will create a robust, 
comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins and tokenized assets, potentially unlocking new 
opportunities for Coinbase and solidifying U.S. leadership in digital finance.

Chapter 4: Q3’25 Outlook. We anticipate July transaction revenue to be approximately $360 million. We 
expect Q3 subscription and services revenue to be within $665-$745 million driven primarily by higher average 
crypto prices and stablecoin revenue (new all-time high in USDC market capitalization in July). We expect Q3 
transaction expenses to be in the mid-teens as a percent of net revenue. We expect technology & development 
and general & administrative expenses to range from $800-$850 million driven by headcount growth to support 
international expansion, new product initiatives, and fortifying customer support & security functions. Finally, we 
expect sales & marketing expenses to be in the range of $190-$290 million, driven by potential variability in 1) 
performance marketing and 2) customer USDC balances in Coinbase products, which drive USDC rewards.

Q2 was a solid quarter amid lower volatility

Total revenue in Q2 was $1.5 billion, down 26% Q/Q. Transaction revenue was $764 million, down 39% Q/Q. 

Subscription and services revenue was $656 million, down 6% Q/Q. Total operating expenses grew $193 

million or 15% Q/Q to $1.5 billion, driven by $307 million in expenses related to the data theft incident disclosed 

in May. Technology & Development, General & Administrative, and Sales & Marketing expenses collectively 

decreased 2% to $977 million as we decreased variable expenses given softer market conditions (notably 

performance marketing) and had lower policy-related spend. Net income was $1.4 billion, Adjusted Net Income 

was $33 million (excluding $1.5 billion in pre-tax gains on strategic investments—which included an unrealized 

gain on our investment in Circle—and a $362 million pre-tax gain on our crypto investment portfolio (largely 

unrealized)), and Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million.

Note: Figures presented may not 
sum precisely due to rounding.

1 Starting in Q1’25, Custodial Fee 
revenue has been condensed into 
Other Subscription and Services 
revenue and will no longer be 
disclosed as a separate line item 
as it now comprises a smaller 
percentage of our subscription and 
services revenue. Prior periods 
have been recast to conform to 
current period presentation.

2 Crypto Asset Volatility represents 
our internal measure of crypto 
asset volatility in the market 
relative to prior periods. The 
volatility is based on intraday 
returns of a volume-weighted 
basket of all assets listed on our 
trading platform. These returns are 
used to compute the basket’s 
intraday volatility which is then 
scaled to a daily window. These 
daily volatility values are then 
averaged over the applicable time 
period as needed.

3 Trading Volume represents the 
total US dollar equivalent value of 
spot matched trades transacted 
between a buyer and seller 
through our platform during the 
period of measurement.

Transaction Revenue

Crypto spot volumes—both globally and in the US—were down 31% and 32% Q/Q, respectively, against a 

market backdrop where we saw average crypto market capitalization approximately flat Q/Q and Crypto Asset 
Volatility2 down 16% Q/Q. 

Q2 transaction revenue was $764 million, down 39% Q/Q, and our total Trading Volume3 was down 40% Q/Q 
to $237 billion, underperforming the spot markets. However, the majority of this underperformance came from 

lower stablecoin pair Trading Volume driven by an intentional pricing change we made in March as we evolved 

our stablecoin strategy. Excluding the impact of stablecoin pair volume, our total Trading Volume was down 

more similar to the spot market overall.

Consumer Transaction Revenue. Consumer Trading Volume was $43 billion, down 45% Q/Q. Consumer 

transaction revenue was $650 million, down 41% Q/Q. Spot volume mix on the platform shifted more toward 

Simple in Q2. Historically, Advanced trading activity tends to be more correlated with market volatility, which 

declined in Q2. Additionally, the intentional pricing change on stablecoin pair trading disproportionately affected 

Advanced platform volumes where most of that activity was taking place.

Institutional Transaction Revenue. Institutional Trading Volume was $194 billion, down 38% Q/Q. Institutional 

transaction revenue was $61 million, down 38% Q/Q, in-line with the decline in Institutional Trading Volume.

Other Transaction Revenue. Other transaction revenue was $54 million, down 21% Q/Q. While the number of 

transactions on Base Chain continued to increase, average revenue per transaction decreased meaningfully, 

driven by our continued scaling efforts. Transaction processing time is now measured in milliseconds and costs 

millicents, surpassing our initial goals of 1 second for 1 cent and making the economics of building onchain 

increasingly favorable.

Note: Figures presented may 
not sum precisely due to 
rounding.

Subscription and Services Revenue

Q2 Subscription and services revenue was $656 million, down 6% Q/Q. We continued to drive growth in 

average USDC balances, native units staked, net inflows to our custody platform—where we reached an all-

time high share of 7% of total crypto market cap—as well as all-time high average loan balances across our 

Prime Financing products. However, these were more than offset by headwinds from declines in average asset 

prices (primarily ETH and SOL), lower protocol rewards rates, and lower customer custodial fiat balances.

Stablecoin revenue grew 12% Q/Q to $332 million in Q2. Average USDC balances held in Coinbase products 

increased 13% Q/Q to $13.8 billion. Meanwhile, average off-platform USDC balances increased 13% Q/Q to 

$47.4 billion.

Rewards continue to be an important driver of USDC growth and adoption. We saw increased deposits of 

USDC on our International Exchange driven by our boosted rewards promotion. Additionally in Q2, we 

integrated USDC across our stablecoin payments platform (see Chapter 2 for additional details).

[2] For Q2 2025.

Blockchain rewards revenue was $145 million, down 26% Q/Q. We drove a Q/Q increase in native units staked 

with the rollout of one-click staking to reduce the friction and complexity for retail users to begin earning 

rewards. Additionally, we saw an uplift stemming from regulatory clarity with strong inflows from users in South 

Carolina who were able to stake again following the dismissal of the staking lawsuit. More than offsetting these 

inflows were lower average prices of both ETH and SOL (nearly 20% Q/Q) and lower protocol rewards rates in 

Q2 vs. Q1.

Interest and finance fee income was $59 million, down 6% Q/Q. Prime Financing revenue was up Q/Q driven 

by all-time high average loan balances in Q2. Demand for financing products remains strong—we saw double 

digit growth in active customers in Q2—across an increasingly diverse client base, including corporates and 

miners. More than offsetting this was lower interest income on custodial fiat primarily driven by lower average 

balances given the decline in trading activity.

Other subscription and services revenue was $119 million, down 15% Q/Q. There were two factors which drove 

the majority of the Q/Q decline:

First was Custodial fee revenue. Assets Under Custody reached a record $245.7 billion, driven by strong native 

units inflows from ETFs and Corporate purchases. We maintain an 80%+ custody share of crypto ETF assets, 

and Coinbase is the trusted custodian for 8 out of the top 10 publicly traded companies with BTC on their 

balance sheet. More than offsetting this growth, however, was lower blended fee rates driven by customer mix 

and lower non-BTC asset prices. 

Second, Coinbase One revenues declined modestly Q/Q, but remained more stable than our trading business.

Expenses

Total Q2 operating expenses grew $193 million or 15% Q/Q to $1.5 billion. This included $308 million in Other 

operating expenses, substantially all of which were related to costs associated with the data theft incident we 

5

disclosed in May. Technology & development, general & administrative, and sales & marketing collectively 

decreased 2% Q/Q to $977 million. We ended the quarter with 4,279 full-time employees, up 8% Q/Q.

not sum precisely due to

Q2 transaction expenses were $245 million, down 19% Q/Q, primarily driven by a decrease in customer trading 

activity and lower blockchain reward fees related to lower average asset prices. Transaction expenses as a 

percentage of net revenue increased slightly to 17% as we continued to utilize rebates and incentives to build 

open interest in our derivatives business.

Technology and development expenses were $387 million, up 9% Q/Q. The increase was driven primarily by 

higher personnel related expenses. We also incurred higher variable software spend related to a project to 

strengthen our infrastructure and reposition our vendor portfolio.

General and administrative expenses were $354 million, down 10% Q/Q. The decrease was driven by lower 

policy-related spend and lower expenses associated with the softer market conditions in Q2. These reductions 

were slightly offset by higher professional services expenses related to recent M&A activity and efforts to help 

ensure regulatory compliance globally, notably obtaining our MiCA license in Europe.

Sales and marketing expenses were $236 million, down 4% Q/Q. Variable marketing was lower Q/Q amidst 

softening marketing conditions in the quarter. However, this decrease was partially offset by seasonal spend 

associated with our NBA sponsorship in addition to higher rewards on USDC.

Other operating expenses, net were $308 million, primarily from the data theft incident disclosed in May, which 

included voluntary customer reimbursements and direct legal costs. 

Stock-based compensation expense was $196 million, up 3% Q/Q, and in-line with our outlook.

Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 22%.

Net income in Q2 was $1.4 billion. This was impacted by $362 million in pre-tax gains on our crypto asset 

investment portfolio—which was largely unrealized—as well as $1.5 billion in Other income largely driven by 

gains on the fair value remeasurement of our investment in Circle. Adjusted Net Income was $33 million and 

Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. We have updated our Adjusted Net Income calculation to adjust for both 

gains and losses on both crypto investments and strategic investments. 

Share Count

Our fully diluted share count at the end of Q2 was 289 million. Included in this figure are 256 million common 

shares and 33 million dilutive shares. In Q2, we also withheld approximately 383 thousand shares from net 

6

share settlement of employee equity awards. Instead of selling shares into the market to cover taxes on these 

equity awards, we pay the taxes and we withhold those shares, which has the same effect as a stock buyback.

Capital and Liquidity

At the end of Q2, we had $9.3 billion in $USD resources1, declining $590 million or 6% Q/Q. The decrease was 
driven primarily by an increase in fiat loan originations and purchases for our crypto asset investment portfolio.

We consider our crypto assets for investment and certain crypto assets held a collateral as other liquidity 

resources available to us. In Q2, we increased our bitcoin holdings by $222 million, driven by weekly purchases 

for our crypto investment portfolio. As of June 30, 2025, the fair market value of our crypto assets held for 

investment and our crypto assets held as collateral were $1.8 billion and $951 million, respectively. When 

including these crypto assets, total available resources totaled $12.1 billion.

Collateralized Arrangements & Financing and Counterparty Risk

We maintained our longstanding commitment to operating and risk excellence in Q2. At the end of Q2, we had 

$1.1 billion in total credit and counterparty risk (excluding banks), stemming from $879 million in collateralized 

loans to customers and $203 million held at third-party venues (including $110 million in unrestricted cash). As 

a reminder, our loans require 100% in collateral (including recent facilities extended to BTC miners), and are 

subject to rigorous risk monitoring.

Chapter 2

Building the financial system onchain through every phase of adoption

Crypto adoption happens in phases—first as an investment, second as a financial service, and third as an app 

platform—and Coinbase is building the products that meet users at each step. We provide a trusted platform 

for users and institutions to invest through trading and custody, bringing assets onto our platform. We provide 

financial services that let users do more with those assets from staking and spending to running their 

businesses with crypto. We provide the infrastructure to scale this ecosystem, with Base Chain as a fast, low-

cost network, and stablecoins like USDC as trusted digital money. And we debuted the new Base App which 

serves as the front door to the onchain economy. In Q2, we made meaningful progress across each phase, 

furthering our mission of increasing economic freedom.

Crypto as an Investment: Trading is the first established use case in crypto, and Coinbase is focused on 

supporting that with the most trusted, comprehensive platform in the market. In Q2, we continued to add more 

assets to our platform, scaled our derivatives offering, and grew institutional adoption, advancing our goal of 

making Coinbase the easiest way to invest in and engage with crypto. Some of these efforts are long-standing 

strengths, others are earlier bets, but each gets us one step closer to building an everything exchange, one 

platform for everything you can trade onchain.

Spot & Simple Trading: Expanding Access to the Assets Users Want

• We recently exceeded 300 spot assets listed on our platform, continuing to meet the top request from 

users: more assets to trade.

•

In Q2, we announced plans for DEX trading integration, which we anticipate will bring access to 

millions of assets directly into the Base App, and allow builders to gain distribution by making their 

tokens available to millions of Coinbase users from day one.

Derivatives: Scaling a Durable, Global Business

•

Over the past two years, 75% of global crypto trading volume has come from derivatives, yet the U.S. 

market makes up only a fraction of this volume, which presents a significant growth opportunity. To 

grow this market we:

◦

◦

Launched the broadest suite of CFTC-regulated crypto perpetual futures products in the U.S. 

in July, trading 24/7 and offering up to 10x intra-day leverage, closing a key gap in domestic 

market access.

Became the first U.S. regulated futures exchange to offer 24/7 futures trading for BTC, ETH, 

SOL, and XRP, with weekend volumes now approaching weekday volumes.

•

•

Abroad we saw all-time highs in derivative trading volume, open interest, and customer balances on 

our international derivatives exchange, driven by targeted incentives and product expansion.

Our acquisition of Deribit, the global leader in crypto options, which we announced in Q2, is expected 

to close by December 31, 2025. This will expand our derivatives product suite and international 

presence, adds a more stable revenue stream via options trading, and will enable greater capital 

efficiency for traders.

Excludes Deribit, which 
acquisition is expected to close 
by December 31, 2025.

Custody at Scale: Coinbase as the Default Institutional Partner

•

•

Assets Under Custody (AUC) share reached an all-time high of total crypto asset market cap with 

$245.7 billion AUC driven by strong inflows from ETFs and Corporate purchases. 

Coinbase is the custodian for over 80% of U.S. BTC and ETH ETF assets as of the end of Q2.

Crypto as a Financial Service: Once users bring assets onto Coinbase, the next step is putting those assets 

to work in ways that mirror and improve on traditional financial services. In Q2, we continued building this new 

financial system, launching products that make crypto more usable in everyday life.

Financing: Powering Liquidity Across the Crypto Economy

•

Prime Financing hits record highs: In Q2 we saw all-time high in average loan balances, fueled by 

growing demand from corporates, miners, and market makers, on top of longstanding activity and 

success with hedge funds, asset managers, and others resulting in a more diversified loan book. We 

continue to see this business drive our institutional flywheel as 16 of our top 25 institutional clients by 

revenue are actively using our financing products.

•

Retail crypto-backed loans gaining traction: Earlier this year we launched instant BTC-backed loans in 

the Coinbase app allowing users to borrow up to $1 million in USDC. Powered by the Morpho protocol 

and Base Chain, loans settle instantly and integrate seamlessly with Coinbase’s broader product 

suite. We’ve now surpassed $1 billion in open loan collateral, showing strong product-market fit and 

growing user appetite for onchain financing tools.

Building a Full-Stack Stablecoin Payments Platform

• We announced the pilot of Coinbase Business, our new platform for startups and small businesses 

offering a secure, compliant way to send and receive crypto payments, manage crypto assets, and 

automate financial workflows all from a single account. We’re seeing great early traction with 3,700+ 

businesses joining the Coinbase Business waitlist. 

•

USDC payments on Base Chain are now live in Shopify Payments, with full rollout to all stores 

planned later this year. This integration enables existing Shopify merchants to accept USDC payments 

from their customers. Shopify plans to provide customers in the U.S. with 1% rewards when paying 

with USDC.

9

Coinbase One: Boosting Value and Increasing Options for Members

•

In Q2, we introduced Coinbase One Basic, our $4.99/month subscription plan, to make the full bundle 

of benefits (including zero-fee trading, boosted rewards, onchain benefits, and early access to 

Coinbase One Card, among others) accessible to more users. While still early, we’re seeing strong 

demand from new subscribers, both in the U.S. and internationally.

•

At our State of Crypto conference we also unveiled the Coinbase One Card, a sleek, everyday 

spending card that lets Coinbase One subscribers earn up to 4% back in bitcoin on every purchase, 

powered by the American Express® network. While still early, we’ve seen great early interest, creating 

a powerful funnel for Coinbase One growth. We plan to begin making the card available to subscribers 

in the second half of this year.

Staking: Strengthening User Engagement with Simple, Compliant Access

• We launched One-Click Staking to simplify the user experience, resulting in a significant uplift in 

staking volumes.

•

Regulatory tailwinds are beginning to play out—South Carolina dropped its lawsuit enabling us to re-

enable staking services.

Crypto as an App Platform: The next chapter of crypto adoption is about more than financial services. It is 

about powering a new generation of onchain applications. This onchain app platform starts with Base Chain, a 

lightning-fast and low-cost network delivering sub-second, sub-cent transactions at scale. Next digital money 

with stablecoins, which enable seamless and trusted payments across the ecosystem. And it comes to life in 

the Base App, the front door to everything onchain; an all in one hub where builders launch and users explore 

apps across trading, social, payments, messaging, games, and more.

Base Chain: Fast, Cheap, Open, and Decentralized.

•

Continued growth in transactions Q/Q, driven by trading, social, payments, and lending apps.

• Millicents and milliseconds: cemented Base Chain’s standing as the fastest, cheapest L2 as we drove 

median fees down to $0.0005; and we reduced block times to 200ms.

•

•

Reached Stage 1 decentralization by launching permissionless fault proofs and adding a security 

council to implement upgrades, an important step toward a more open, global onchain economy.

Institutional adoption: J.P. Morgan launched a pilot of its USD-backed deposit token (JPMD) on Base 

Chain.

Stablecoins: Trusted Onchain Money

•

•

•

•

The global stablecoin market cap has now reached over $265 billion, growing for the fourth 

consecutive quarter.

Cross-border payments are one of the most compelling use cases for stablecoins, representing a $40 

trillion global market opportunity.

Base Chain remains a key driver of USDC distribution, over 90% of peer-to-peer transaction volume 

on Base was with USDC in Q2.

Continued integration across our global products including Coinbase Business, Base Chain, and the 

Base App is expanding stablecoin utility and reinforcing our platform flywheel.

10

Base App: The app for everything onchain

•

•

Base App recently went into beta featuring a redesigned consumer experience that brings wallet 

functionality together with onchain trading, payments, social, messaging, and apps—all in one place.

Key features include:

◦

◦

Social Feed: A new kind of social experience where users fully own their content and get paid 

for engagement. This solves the problem of creator monetization and data ownership on 

traditional platforms. Powered by Farcaster and Zora.

Trading and Payments: Buy, sell, send, and explore millions of tokens 24/7, all while 

maintaining full control of assets through a self-custody smart wallet. This removes reliance 

on intermediaries and enables global, permissionless finance.

◦ Mini Apps: Onchain apps that run seamlessly inside the social feed and messages. This 

eliminates the friction of switching apps or creating new accounts, delivering a truly native 

mobile onchain experience.

◦

◦

Base Account: A smart wallet and universal onchain identity that enables one-click login and 

consistent use across apps and chains. This solves the fragmented wallet and identity 

experience that has slowed broader crypto adoption.

Base Pay: An express checkout for stablecoin payments, now live on Shopify. This makes it 

easy for merchants and developers to integrate faster, cheaper global payments with crypto.

Chapter 3

Significant progress in policy and regulatory clarity.

We see increasing momentum for the industry in the U.S. After years of ambiguity, lawmakers and regulators 

are embracing thoughtful, pro-innovation frameworks to govern the next era of financial infrastructure. This is 

critical for global alignment: from Washington to Luxembourg, we're working to ensure that crypto rules are 

clear, fair, and globally competitive.

GENIUS Act Becomes Law: A Defining Milestone for Stablecoin Regulation

•

The GENIUS Act was signed into law, the first-ever U.S. federal legislation for digital assets. It 

establishes clear rules for USD stablecoin issuers and custodians, paving the way for broader 

stablecoin adoption.

CLARITY Act passed by the House: Setting Out a Market Structure Framework for Digital Assets and 

Crypto Intermediaries

•

•

The CLARITY Act passed the House with even broader bipartisan support than FIT 21, underscoring 
that crypto is one of the most bipartisan issues in Washington today.

Together with GENIUS, these laws provide the regulatory framework for stablecoins and tokenized 
assets, unlocking new market opportunities for Coinbase and reinforcing U.S. leadership in digital 
finance and innovation.

International Leadership: MiCA License Secured in Luxembourg

•

•

Coinbase secured its MiCA license in Luxembourg in June authorizing our core retail and institutional 
services across 30 EEA member states.

GENIUS is already influencing global policymakers, particularly in Europe, where concerns around 
dollarization are pushing regulators to reassess their own stablecoin efforts.

Litigation: Defending Innovation and Clarity Through the Courts

• While there has been significant bipartisan progress at the federal level on regulatory clarity, a few 

states are still pursuing a patchwork approach to crypto regulation. In April, Oregon sued Coinbase in 

a largely copycat of the SEC’s action, which the SEC dismissed with prejudice. And five states (CA, 

MD, NJ, WA, WI) continue pursuing actions related to our staking services, despite five other states 

dismissing similar actions and recent SEC guidance that staking services like ours are not securities. 

We continue to engage with regulators, while fighting those misguided state actions.

Q3’25 Outlook

Coinbase Q3 2025 Outlook

METRIC

Subscription and Services Revenue

Transaction Expenses

Technology & Development +
General & Administrative Expenses

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Transaction Revenue

OUTLOOK

$665-$745 million

Mid-Teens as a percentage of net revenue
Dependent on revenue mix

$800-$850 million
Including ~$210 million in stock-based compensation

$190-$290 million
Including ~$15 million in stock-based compensation

We anticipate July transaction revenue to be approximately $360 million. As always, we continue to urge 

caution in extrapolating these results.

Subscription and Services Revenue

We expect Q3 subscription and services revenue to be within $665-$745 million. We expect Q/Q growth to be 

driven primarily by 1) higher average crypto asset prices (Q3 to date, we have already observed ETH up 45% 

and SOL up 14% as compared to their Q2 average prices) and 2) stablecoin revenue, as USDC market 

capitalization reached an all-time high in July.

Expenses

We expect technology & development and general & administrative expenses to be between $800-$850 

million. The sequential increase is driven by headcount, which is growing at a higher rate in Q3 than it did in 

Q2. The opportunities for growth have expanded substantially with increased regulatory clarity. We are taking 

this opportunity to grow headcount in exciting areas we expect to become meaningful in the future, including 

international expansion and new product initiatives while also fortifying our customer support and security 

functions as part of our commitment to being the most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. The breadth of the 

range reflects current market volatility which has an impact on certain variable expenses including customer 

support and infrastructure costs.

Sales and marketing expenses are expected to be in the range of $190-$290 million. We continue to monitor 

current market conditions and expect additional opportunities to continue to invest in marketing initiatives 

through the rest of the quarter. Where we fall within the range will largely be determined by 1) whether we 

continue to see attractive performance marketing opportunities throughout the remainder of Q3, which have 

historically largely correlated with market volatility and asset prices and 2) USDC balances in Coinbase 

products, which drive USDC rewards.

This outlook does not include costs related to our acquisition of Deribit.

Webcast Information

We will host a conference call to discuss the results for the second quarter 2025 on July 31, 2025 at 2:30 pm 

PT. The live webcast of the call will be available at youtube.com/@coinbase/streams. A replay of the call, as 

well as a transcript, will be available on our Investor Relations website at investor.coinbase.com.

Forward-Looking Statements

This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 

1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are 

not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, including for the third quarter ending 

September 30, 2025; anticipated future expenses and investments; the expected timing for completion, benefits, and impacts of 

our proposed acquisition of Deribit; expectations relating to certain of our key financial and operating metrics; our business 

strategy and plans; expectations relating to legal and regulatory proceedings; expectations relating to our industry, the regulatory 

environment, market conditions, trends and growth; expectations relating to customer behaviors and preferences; our market 

position; potential market opportunities; and our objectives for future operations. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” 

“potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are 

intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, 

assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made. These forward-looking 

statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among others: our ability to successfully 

execute our business and growth strategy and generate future profitability; market acceptance of our products and services; our 

ability to further penetrate our existing customer base and expand our customer base; our ability to develop new products and 

services; our ability to expand internationally; failure to obtain applicable regulatory approvals and satisfy other closing conditions 

in a timely manner or otherwise for any acquisition we make, including Deribit; the success of any acquisitions or investments that 

we make; the effects of increased competition in our markets; our ability to stay in compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations; stock price fluctuations; market conditions across the cryptoeconomy, including crypto asset price volatility; and 

general market, political, and economic conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, inflation, tariffs, instability in the global 

banking system, economic downturns, and other global events, including regional wars and conflicts and government shutdowns. 

It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent 

to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-

looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, our actual results could differ materially 

and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause 

actual results to differ materially from forecasted results are, or will be included, in our filings we make with the Securities and 

Exchange Commission (SEC) from time to time, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 

2025 filed with the SEC on July 31, 2025. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking 

statements, or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance 

measure, is useful information to help investors evaluate our operating performance because it: enables investors to compare 

this measure and component adjustments to similar information provided by peer companies and our past financial performance; 

provides additional company-specific adjustments for certain items that may be included in income from operations but that we do 

not consider to be normal, recurring, operating expenses (or income) necessary to operate our business given our operations, 

revenue generating activities, business strategy, industry, and regulatory environment; and provides investors with visibility to a 

measure management uses to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. For example:

• We believe it is useful to exclude certain non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based 

compensation, from Adjusted EBITDA because the amounts of such expenses can vary significantly from period to 

period and may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations.

• We believe it is useful to exclude certain items that we do not consider to be normal, recurring, cash operating expenses 

and therefore, not reflective of our ongoing business operations. For example, we exclude: (i) other (income) expense, 

net, as the income and expenses recognized in this line item are not part of our core operating activities and are 

considered non-operating activities under GAAP, (ii) gains and losses on crypto assets held for investment because 

14

such investments are considered primarily long-term holdings, and (iii) losses directly related to the data theft incident 

announced on the Current Report on Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on May 15, 2025 (the “Data Theft Incident”), 

including voluntary customer reimbursements, direct legal costs, and reward payments, if any, in connection with the 

threat actor’s arrest and conviction. We do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets, and, as an operating 

company, our investing activities in crypto are not part of our revenue generating activities, which are based on 

transactions on our platform and the sales of subscriptions and services. 

• We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as 

stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, 

net, and provision for (benefit from) income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon 

their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income 

per Share, both non-GAAP financial performance measures, are useful information to help investors evaluate our operating 

performance. We believe it is useful to exclude tax-effected gains and losses on crypto assets held for investment from both 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share because (i) such investments are considered primarily long-term 

holdings, (ii) we do not plan on engaging in regular trading of crypto assets, and, (iii) as an operating company, our investing 

activities in crypto are not part of our revenue generating activities, which are based on transactions on our platform and the sales 

of subscriptions and services. Additionally, we believe it is useful to exclude tax-effected gains and losses on our strategic 

investments from Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share because such investments are not part of our core 

operating activities and are considered non-operating activities under GAAP. 

Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors for the reasons noted above. However, non-GAAP 

financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools, and should 

not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other 

companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other 

measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our disclosure of non-GAAP financial 

measures as a tool for comparison. 

Adjusted EBITDA

There are a number of limitations related to Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent of 

Adjusted EBITDA. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA excludes:

•

•

•

•

•

•

provision for (benefit from) income taxes;

interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which 

reduces cash available to us;

depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and 

amortized may have to be replaced in the future;

stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant 

recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

losses directly related to the Data Theft Incident;

net gains or losses on our crypto assets held for investment; and

15

•

other (income) expense, net, which represents net gains or losses on strategic investments and other financial 

instruments, and other non-operating income and expense activity.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share

There are limitations related to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share rather than net income and net income 

per share, which are the nearest GAAP equivalents, respectively, including that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income 

per Share each exclude the tax-effected impact of our crypto investment gains/losses and of our strategic investments gains/

losses.

Additional Information

For more information, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents, please 

see  the  reconciliation  of  GAAP  to  non-GAAP  results  tables  in  this  shareholder  letter.  Investors  are  encouraged  to  review  the 

related GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
