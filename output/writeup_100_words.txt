We forecast Q3’25 revenue of $1734M (Transaction $976M, Subscriptions & Services $679M, Other $79M). Transaction revenue reflects Q3 spot/derivatives volume of $434B at a blended take rate of 23.0bps, incorporating retail/institutional mix. Subscriptions & Services is driven by USDC interest (avg supply $67.3B at 3.84% short rate, Coinbase share 50%), staking (avg staked AUM $60B; take 25%), and custody AUC of $246B. Assumptions draw from Q2’25 10-Q, Coinbase IR, Circle attestations, FRED rates, and public exchange data. Scenario and sensitivity analysis support the base case.\
